Workforce Analytics - How is the Workforce Analytics Priced?
The list price of Workforce Analystics is $50 per employee.
This reflects the value and potential cost savings as well as
the time and cost it would take for a customer to build it
themselves. There is a minimum base price of $35,000 that
must be reached in each deal for the software license (actual,
not list). In other words, if the customer has 1,000 employees
and pays $30 per employee after discounts, the software
license price would only be $30,000 - the customer must pay
the base of $35,000 in license fees. If, however the customer
has 2,000 employees the customer would pay $60,000 at
$30,000 per employee. Normal discounting rules apply as
set out recently.
Workforce Analytics v6 8603078-000 is a License only part number and requires ESD SW kit part # 8100006-001 to be ordered @ N/C.

Workforce Analytics - How is the Workforce Analytics Priced? |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
The list price of Workforce Analystics is $50 per employee.
This reflects the value and potential cost savings as well as
the time and cost it would take for a customer to build it
themselves. There is a minimum base price of $35,000 that
must be reached in each deal for the software license (actual,
not list). In other words, if the customer has 1,000 employees
and pays $30 per employee after discounts, the software
license price would only be $30,000 - the customer must pay
the base of $35,000 in license fees. If, however the customer
has 2,000 employees the customer would pay $60,000 at
$30,000 per employee. Normal discounting rules apply as
set out recently. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Workforce Analytics - How is the Workforce Analytics Priced?
The list price of Workforce Analytics is $50 per
employee. This reflects the value and potential
cost savings as well as the time and cost it would
take for a customer to build it themselves. There is
a minimum base price of $35,000 that must be
reached in each deal for the software license
(actual, not list). In other words, if the customer
has 1,000 employees and pays $30 per employee
after discounts, the software license price would
only be $30,000 – the customer must pay the base
of $35,000 in license fees. If, however the
customer has 2,000 employees the customer
would pay $60,000 at $30 per employee. Normal
discounting rules apply as set out recently.
Workforce Analytics for Retail follows the same pattern, but costs $60 per employee.
Service costs will vary significantly depending on the scope of work, but expect an absolute minimum of $40,000.
