TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE
2. SALES PRICE; PAYMENT; TAXES. Purchaser agrees to pay the unit price of each item of Equipment set forth herein, less any security deposit, as specified herein.

Interest on any past-due payments shall accrue at the rate of one and one-half percent ( $1.5 \%$ ) per month or at the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is less. All prices are exclusive of applicable taxes or other charges imposed by law and are F.O.B. Seller's dock or other specified site. All taxes or other charges will be added to the price and itemized or invoiced separately. The purchase price, together with any accrued interest, taxes, or other charges, is due on demand unless provided otherwise in writing.
3. SITE PREPARATION. Purchaser is solely responsible for site preparation.
4. EXTRA FEATURES AND OTHER GOODS. If the Equipment on delivery contains any features and/or other goods not specified in this Sales Agreement, Purchaser hereby grants Seller, at Seller's option and expense, the right to remove any of such features. Such removal shall be performed by the manufacturer or another party acceptable to Purchaser, upon the request of Seller, at a time convenient to Purchaser, provided that Purchaser shall not unreasonably delay the removal of such features.
5. TITLE; RISK OF LOSS; SECURITY INTEREST; REMEDIES ON DEFAULT. Title and ownership to each item of Equipment sold pursuant to this Sales Agreement shall remain in the Seller until payment is made in full, including any additional charges provided for herein. Risk of loss shall pass to Purchaser upon delivery to the common carrier or Purchaser's delivery agent. Purchaser expressly agrees to keep in full force fire, theft, and accident insurance for the benefit of both parties as their interests may appear from the date of delivery.

Seller (Secured Party) reserves, and Purchaser (Debtor) hereby grants to Seller, a purchase money security interest in the Equipment sold hereunder as security for performance of the Purchaser's obligations. This document, if signed by Purchaser, may be filed to evidence the security interest granted herein.

Should Purchaser fail to perform any of its obligations pursuant to this Sales Agreement, or default in payment of any charges due hereunder, Seller may, at its option, do any of the following: (i) terminate this Sales Agreement upon notice to Purchaser; (ii) whether or not this Sales Agreement is terminated, take possession of any or all of the Equipment listed hereon or in any attachment hereto, wherever situated, and for such purpose, enter upon any premises without liability for doing so; (iii) retain all or a portion of the security deposit, if any, previously paid by Purchaser as an offset to Purchaser's liability for such default; and (iv) suspend performance under this or any other agreement with Purchaser. Repossession of the Equipment, if at Seller's direction, shall not be deemed a waiver of Seller's right to damages it may sustain as a result of Purchaser's default and Seller shall have the right to enforce any other legal remedy as provided by law. Purchaser shall in any event remain fully liable for damages resulting from breach including, but not limited to, all costs and expenses incurred by Seller on account of such breach including court or arbitration costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. The rights afforded Seller hereunder shall not be deemed to be exclusive, but shall be in addition to any rights or remedies provided by law.

# 6. WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMERS. 

(a) Equipment: Seller represents and warrants that, at the time each item of Equipment is delivered, Seller will be the lawful owner of such Equipment, free and clear of any liens and encumbrances (other than those which may arise from this Sales Agreement) and will have full right, power, and authority to sell the same to Purchaser.

=== Page 3 ===
Except for Equipment sold "AS IS," Seller further warrants that the Equipment will be free from defects in material at the time of delivery to Purchaser or when tendered to Purchaser's delivery agent or common carrier and for a period of 30 days thereafter. Seller's sole warranty liability shall be limited to repair or replacement of the Equipment at Seller's sole discretion. Seller shall not be liable, and the warranty shall be void, in the event of misuse, abuse, or unauthorized repairs to the Equipment. The parties agree that the Seller is not obligated and has no liability for failure to arrange for and secure a maintenance agreement on the Equipment.

Purchaser, recognizing that Seller is not the manufacturer of the Equipment, expressly waives any claim against Seller based on any infringement or alleged infringement of any patent with respect to any item of Equipment or for any indemnity against such patent claim made by another against Purchaser. Seller shall pass all manufacturers' warranties along to Purchaser, which such warranties shall be primary to any warranty provided herein.
(b) Services: Seller warrants to Client that during the term of this contract and for a period of ninety ( 90 ) days from the completion of services, that the services provided hereunder shall (a) be performed in a workmanlike manner in accordance with applicable commercial standards; (b) comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation and Seller will have obtained all permits required to comply with such laws and regulations and (c) not violate or infringe upon any presently issued US copyright, patent, trade secret or other property, contractual, employment or confidentiality right of a third party.

Client accepts sole responsibility for the use of any software or other materials delivered hereunder to achieve Clients intended results and the results actually obtained from such software or materials. In no event shall Seller be liable for any incidental or consequential damages. In the event that Seller fails to cause the Services to conform to the foregoing warranties within a reasonable time after notification, Client and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy shall be to terminate this contract and receive a refund of any feed paid to ENTREPID for the non-conforming Services.
(c) Misc.: Purchaser expressly waives any claim against the seller, not being the manufacturer of the equipment, including hardware, firmware and software, related to failure of the equipment to function without error or interruption related to date data from before and after the Year 2000 or from more than one century, or from date elements in interfaces and data storage. As used herein "date data" means any data or input, which includes an indication of or reference to date.

THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES HEREIN ARE IN LIEU OF ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS NOT RELYING ON SELLER'S SKILL OR JUDGMENT TO SELECT OR FURNISH ANY PARTICULAR ITEM OF EQUIPMENT OR SERVICE FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND THAT THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES WHICH ARE NOT CONTAINED IN THIS SALES AGREEMENT. SELLER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, OR FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, NOR FOR ANY CLAIM OR DEMAND AGAINST THE PURCHASER BY ANY OTHER PARTY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH PERFORMANCE OF THE EQUIPMENT, LOSS OF USE OF THE EQUIPMENT OR ITS USE BY PURCHASER, OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
7. FORCE MAJEURE. Seller shall not be liable for any failure or delay in furnishing the Equipment, materials, or labor resulting from fire, explosion, flood, storm, act of God, governmental acts, orders or regulations, hostilities, civil disturbance, strike, labor difficulties, machinery breakdown, transportation contingencies, difficulty in obtaining parts, supplies, shipping facilities, delay of carriers, or any other cause beyond the control of Seller.
8. ARBITRATION. Seller and Purchaser agree to submit all disputes of whatever kind or nature, whether in law or in equity, arising out of this or any other agreement between the parties or their affiliates, to binding arbitration only to be conducted pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association, and such arbitration shall be held in the city of Pittsfield, MA. The parties agree that the non-prevailing party shall be liable for all costs of arbitration, including the prevailing party's attorneys' fees and costs. The parties further agree that any monetary award may be reduced to judgment and docketed in any court of competent jurisdiction without objection and execution may be had thereon.

# 9. MISCELLANEOUS. 

A. Neither this Sales Agreement, nor any consent or approval provided for herein, shall be binding upon Seller unless signed on its behalf by a duly authorized officer. This Sales Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in the State of MA and shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of MA.
B. This Sales Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Seller and Purchaser with respect to the purchase of the Equipment described herein, superseding all prior correspondence between the parties (including, without limitation, any purchase orders submitted by Purchaser to Seller). No provision of this Sales Agreement shall be deemed waived, amended, or modified by either party unless such waiver, amendment, or modification is in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.
C. This Sales Agreement shall not be assignable by Purchaser without the prior written consent of Seller, and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be void.

=== Page 4 ===
D. All notices herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the other party as set forth herein or to such other address as such party shall have designated by proper notice.
E. If this Sales Agreement shall be executed by Seller prior to being executed by Purchaser, it shall become void, at Seller's option, ten (10) days after the date of Seller's execution thereof, unless Seller shall have received by such date a copy thereof, executed by an authorized representative of Purchaser. Seller shall also have the right to void such Sales Agreement at any time prior to receiving a copy thereof, executed by an authorized representative of Purchaser, by notice to Purchaser sent by U.S. Mail, Facsimile or Telegram, which notice shall be effective upon mailing or dispatch thereof.
