Interest on any past-due payments shall accrue at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or at the maximum rate allowed by law,
whichever is less. All prices are exclusive of applicable taxes or other charges imposed by law and are F.O.B. Seller's dock or other specified site. All
taxes or other charges will be added to the price and itemized or invoiced separately. The purchase price, together with any accrued interest, taxes, or
other charges, is due on demand unless provided otherwise in writing.
3. SITE PREPARATION. Purchaser is solely responsible for site preparation.
4. EXTRA FEATURES AND OTHER GOODS. If the Equipment on delivery contains any features and/or other goods
not specified in this Sales Agreement, Purchaser hereby grants Seller, at Seller's option and expense, the right to remove any of
such features. Such removal shall be performed by the manufacturer or another party acceptable to Purchaser, upon the
request of Seller, at a time convenient to Purchaser, provided that Purchaser shall not unreasonably delay the removal of such
features.
5. TITLE; RISK OF LOSS; SECURITY INTEREST; REMEDIES ON DEFAULT. Title and ownership to each item of
Equipment sold pursuant to this Sales Agreement shall remain in the Seller until payment is made in full, including any

Seller (Secured Party) reserves, and Purchaser (Debtor) hereby grants to Seller, a purchase money security interest in the Equipment sold hereunder
as security for performance of the Purchaser's obligations. This document, if signed by Purchaser, may be filed to evidence the security interest granted

Purchaser's liability for such default; and (iv) suspend performance under this or any other agreement with Purchaser. Repossession of the Equipment,
if at Seller's direction, shall not be deemed a waiver of Seller's right to damages it may sustain as a result of Purchaser's default and Seller shall have
the right to enforce any other legal remedy as provided by law. Purchaser shall in any event remain fully liable for damages resulting from breach
including, but not limited to, all costs and expenses incurred by Seller on account of such breach including court or arbitration costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees. The rights afforded Seller hereunder shall not be deemed to be exclusive, but shall be in addition to any rights or remedies provided by
