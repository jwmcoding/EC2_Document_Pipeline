|  Workforce Analytics - How is the Workforce Analytics Priced? |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  The list price of Workforce Analytics is $50 per employee. This reflects the value and potential cost savings as well as the time and cost it would take for a customer to build it themselves. There is a minimum base price of $35,000 that must be reached in each deal for the software license (actual, not list). In other words, if the customer has 1,000 employees and pays $30 per employee after discounts, the software license price would only be $30,000 - the customer must pay the base of $35,000 in license fees. If, however the customer has 2,000 employees the customer would pay $60,000 at $30,000 per employee. Normal discounting rules apply as set out recently. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |

|  Workforce Analytics - How is the Workforce Analytics Priced? |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  The list price of Workforce Analytics is $50 per employee. This reflects the value and potential cost savings as well as the time and cost it would take for a customer to build it themselves. There is a minimum base price of $35,000 that must be reached in each deal for the software license (actual, not list). In other words, if the customer has 1,000 employees and pays $30 per employee after discounts, the software license price would only be $30,000 – the customer must pay the base of $35,000 in license fees. If, however, the customer has 2,000 employees, the customer would pay $60,000 at $30 per employee. Normal discounting rules apply as set out recently. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  Workforce Analytics for Retail follows the same pattern, but costs $60 per employee. Service costs will vary significantly depending on the scope of work, but expect an absolute minimum of $40,000. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |

Workforce Analytics - How is the Workforce Analytics Priced? |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
The list price of Workforce Analytics is $50 per employee. This reflects the value and potential cost savings as well as the time and cost it would take for a customer to build it themselves. There is a minimum base price of $35,000 that must be reached in each deal for the software license (actual, not list). In other words, if the customer has 1,000 employees and pays $30 per employee after discounts, the software license price would only be $30,000 - the customer must pay the base of $35,000 in license fees. If, however the customer has 2,000 employees the customer would pay $60,000 at $30,000 per employee. Normal discounting rules apply as set out recently. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Workforce Analytics - How is the Workforce Analytics Priced? |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
The list price of Workforce Analytics is $50 per employee. This reflects the value and potential cost savings as well as the time and cost it would take for a customer to build it themselves. There is a minimum base price of $35,000 that must be reached in each deal for the software license (actual, not list). In other words, if the customer has 1,000 employees and pays $30 per employee after discounts, the software license price would only be $30,000 – the customer must pay the base of $35,000 in license fees. If, however, the customer has 2,000 employees, the customer would pay $60,000 at $30 per employee. Normal discounting rules apply as set out recently. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
Workforce Analytics for Retail follows the same pattern, but costs $60 per employee. Service costs will vary significantly depending on the scope of work, but expect an absolute minimum of $40,000. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
