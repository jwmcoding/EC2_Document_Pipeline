        "current_narrative": "Hi Jennifer, Thanks for sending your add-on license purchase for review.  I see Aspect is using the same negotiation tactic as they did in 2016 where they started with a 30% discount and ended with 40%.  That purchase had an extended list price of $300K for licenses while this purchase is at $235K.  The 5% uplift is possible as our last review for Aspect was right at the end of 2017 and Aspect doesn?t publish a price list.  That 2017 review had list prices that matched the ones being shown/offered to Progressive.   They hadn?t raised their prices in a couple of years and my guess is just before your last purchase in 2016 there had been a recent 10% increase.  The Aspect story has changed little: they?ve moved from leader to niche player in the latest Gartner report (Feb 2018), mainly focused on existing clients.  Progressive in effect are investing dollars into the enhancement of a SaaS solution you don't own.  My SME advises postponing the buy if possible (maybe not feasible) and survey the market for better solution and a lower TCO.  Of course, this is a mouthful and easier said than done.  However, it could generate some talking points in support of your negotiation.  Ask about the R&D into the perpetual license solution.  The talent on the R&D and Support side can?t be focused on Progressive?s solution.  Push hard for specifics.  Has the release schedule slowed down?  Less in each release?  Any more major releases expected?  While leverage may not be on your side, this allows you to push for better pricing on this as you double your footprint.  It just makes common sense.  If they indicate less R&D and fewer releases then why are they trying to raise prices.  Feels like they are milking the old product while they furiously work on their SaaS offering.   Focusing back on the commercial terms, we continue to expect to see Mission Critical Maintenance at 22% and Business Day Maintenance at 20%.  This is where Progressive landed in 2016 and that?s the current offer.  It is small dollars but you?d kind of expect the gap to be bigger i.e., Business Day to be 18% vs. MC at 22%; however, they?ve been consistent.  Along the same negotiation points noted above, if Progressive feels as though support is deteriorating and software releases are less robust and fewer and far between that is reason enough to push for a lower percentage.  Maintenance costs are comprised of phone support and software releases and patches so if any aspect is weakening then customers have the right to push for relief.  During our last review we noted that they just emerged from bankruptcy and were struggling to rollout  a cloud offering.  We suggested a 50%+ target but the leverage worked against Progressive and you topped off at 40%.  This feels like a rinse-and-repeat scenario.  40% feels a bit low in light of market conditions and the 2x growth.  NPI suggests targeting a 50% final discount which typically requires pushing for more than that to allow for the compromise.  Achieving a 50% discount drives $23,500 out of license spend and about $3,500 out of support. Driving Mission Critical support to 20% would save an additional $2500.",

        "current_narrative": "When it comes to Verint (or NICE or Aceyus or any other major IVR player), you have two opportunities to get your pricing right, new purchases, and significant upgrades, and that is it. During normal renewal cycles, these companies historically do not move and typically raise prices that are not locked in, anywhere from 3-8% year over year.  In fact, I just finished a review, for a large Midwest Bank, that has been a customer of NICE Systems for some 8 years, , and with the exception of last year, when they did a major upgrade, and the first two renewals, where they had contractually agreed to maintenance, NICE raised their rates every year. Why not last year, because they did a major upgrade. Fast forward 365 days to this renewal, absolutely no love what so ever, 3% increase, across the board, that was the extent of their favoritism.  I have reviewed both your prior and current offers. The original offer at 60% was actually not a bad starting position, considering the size of your environment, although, the 3% increase on maintenance right out of the gate and the maintenance rate based on an initial 22% were both above FMV for certain. The 2nd iteration, at 63% discount and a flat maintenance rate, is definitely a step in the right direction. Keep it up.   The goal here should be to get closer to 70%, but that is not going to happen now and it is most likely not going to happen quickly. AFI missed the end of Q2, so you may have to hold 60-70 days to get all the way to 69-70% and it is going to take competition. Even if NICE has been eliminated, they have to be played up. Aceyus is another vendor that you can work into the conversation as is Cisco.   We can help you brainstorm and set this in motion if you need assistance.",

        "description": "We are evaluating On-Premise and Saas WFM solutions with Verint and Nice.  Is this an area you could benchmark?  A month later got this:  We opted for Verints? On Premise model and have been through a few rounds of pricing.  Attached is a breakdown of where we ended up.  Can you benchmark the ?Current? pricing.  They came down on licensing, Professional Services and of course Support and Maintenance from the first pricing breakdown also included on the attached.  Thanks for your help.  No interest in SaaS. Asked about that discount to capture it   Seemed to say he had a verbal for 70% on perpetual but Mike did review and landed at 63%.  From Pat: Revised quote is forthcoming but the one you posted is the latest.   The difference will be a license fees drop from $400K to $367, Support and Maintenance drops from $264K over 3 years to $220,200 and Professional Services drops from $125K (estimated) to $112.5  Yes, this is the key stuff; perpetual current state.  We did look at SaaS and it is cost prohibitive mostly because both Verint and Nices? solution are not true SaaS.  They both essentially are hosted in their own environment.  Got a revised quote (mike excel). Quantities changed a little and support was uplifted but generally ended as-is.",

        "current_narrative": "Hey Robert, Prior to you sending the revised Safenet offer we had taken some time to try and find all the list prices as they weren?t provided in the quote.  That history can be helpful as you continue negotiations. The prior two offers were at poor discounts of 0-2%.  We couldn?t validate a couple of items.  They have a crazy number of SKUs complicated by a series of acquisitions (Aladdin, Safenet, Gemalto, and Thales (who also own competitor Vormetric)).  I?m attaching our efforts which can be found in the first worksheet.  The feedback was going to be this looks to be budgetary (we hope) and Webster should insist that list prices be provided and also ask for list prices for tiers below and above the quantities you are buying for the Tokenization Manager licenses.  The ?2? at the end of the SKU refers to the second volume tier 11-20.    The recent quote had different SKUs.  Again, I think we figured out the list prices but it requires some art and science.  The two prior quotes totaled about $300K.  The latest is around $700K.  The discount appears to have increased to just under 12%.  See the second worksheet in the Excel file.  I believe all the three-year maintenance items list for 24% of the hw/sw list cost each year and are discounted the same 12% (so they remain at 24% of the NET cost).  Plus Maintenance is priced at 24% and Extended Maintenance (not what Webster is buying) is priced at 18%.  I suggest Webster ask for list prices to validate NPIs figures.  If NPIs list prices are incorrect we?ll want to revisit this review.  At this spend level and in a competitive environment, 30% would be the minimum discount NPI suggests Webster should target and 40%-50% is not an unrealistic goal.  NPI hasn?t seen a ton of SafeNet deals but have seen several smaller ones that landed in the mid to high 20s making 30% our floor.  We have fewer data points on the top end.  We?ve seen a million plus purchase comprised largely of subscriptions at over 60%.  This purchase has a different dollar profile and product mix but it helped to form our ceiling.  NPI can?t provide a narrower target than 35-50% as our estimate of FMV.  With confidence we believe anything under 30% is NOT FMV.  Anything into the 50s at this dollar size feels stellar and a great outcome.  That leaves the wide swath of 30-50%.  Based on our data and this sizable purchase I bumped up the bottom of the range to 35%.  The goal would be to keep Maintenance at the same 24% of the net spend with a best case outcome of 22%.  NPI has seen SafeNet discount hw/sw considerably more than Maintenance.  I?ve included the math supporting our low and high targets in the second worksheet.  If we get any more late-breaking data points I?ll share that info.",

        "current_narrative": "Although the initial discounts offered by Dell EMC are respectable, NPI considers other external factors when classifying pricing and those areas should be considered in this negotiation.  NPI would typically expect to see both Hardware and Software discounted at 70% - 72% for deal of this size. Discounting at 69.5% places this pricing in the high range (and almost above FMV). ? Due to the timing of this fiscal year-end opportunity, NPI has increased the FMV target discount an additional percentage point, up to 73%. Achieving this target will result in approximately $51K in savings. ? Support is typically 20% of net HW/SW pricing for THREE years. In this offer, NPI finds that the support pricing is at 21% of HW/SW pricing, but only covers TWO years. \u00a92017 NPI, LLC. All Rights Reserved. NPI Confidential Information. May Not Be Disclosed to 3rd Parties. Page 3 ? NPI adjusted for this anomaly and increases the target discount to 82% of list for support. This discount results in a number that extrapolates out to 21% for the typical three-year term. Successfully negotiating this topic will result in approximately $39K in savings. ? Professional services is a rarely discounted line item and NPI finds that the small discounts that are seen are typically found in large deployments with large amounts of professional services. o NPI believes that these funds ARE somewhat flexible and because of the small dollar amount, NPI is applying the 23% discount that we periodically find in larger deployments to this proposal. Although this equates to a small $2K in savings, NPI mentions it as another negotiation point for Michael Kors.",

This did not lend itself to a full FMV document, but if you need a more formal document, I can put something together for you.  ?\tOverall, the discounting on years 1 & 2, at ~39% is some of the best discounting we?ve seen.  This is a Corporate VP level discount within Microsoft. o\tWe have other, larger Microsoft clients that are not able to get to that discount level. o\tWe suspect that a combination of a) your relatively low dollar commit, b) only purchasing Core CAL?s, and c) Chico?s next big purchase will be in 2-years with the EA renewal, makes Chico?s a ?target for opportunity? within Microsoft.  Microsoft will be looking to significantly increase the revenue they get from Chico?s, either by adding on new products, or significantly reducing your discount levels at the time of the EA renewal. ?\tIt is common that Microsoft is trying to ramp down the 3rd year discount to 20%.  NPI recommends that you push hard for consistency across all 3-years. ?\tYou will want to be sure to have a ?Not to Exceed? (NTE) clause added to this contract so that the renewal cost does not exceed either CPI or CAGR.  We recommend that you target a NTE 3% increase (over 3-years), but Microsoft will most likely settle on 6% - 10%. ?\tChico?s is receiving solid additional funding in Deployment Funds, CSM, and Fast Track, etc.  There may be even more funding available, but Chico?s would have to tie it to some specific project.  So, overall, Year 1 & 2 pricing are very good.  We recommend that you push for 3rd year consistency and add the NTE.  At that point, Chico?s could move forward with confidence on this purchase.",

Discounting is poor in each category for a $2M+ annual spend, and the 0% discount on subscription items is consistent with a 0% rate on subscriptions in Freddie Mac?s larger EAS. The SCE does provide some automatic discounting on perpetual licensing, but at this size of a net spend across multiple agreements, those discounts do not push pricing into the range of FMV.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI strongly recommends not mentioning specific discounts off the Level C reference pricing.  Microsoft is notorious for standing up to requests that solely revolve around discounts; they are typically much more receptive when clients speak to the larger 3-year TCO plus address the financial exposure risks of the SCE?s encompassing licensing rules. ?\tNPI recommends getting Microsoft to focus on an even budgetary goal of getting the spend under a $6.75M target for the term ($2.25M annual) in exchange for an expedited deal approval that preserves a March signature timeline. ?\tNPI notes that these targets are more conservative to reflect the smaller timeframe available for this deal.  o\tMore aggressive targets would be appropriate with multiple months available for negotiations, but NPI has seen success even within shorter periods.  o\tIf Freddie Mac feels the sales team is especially nervous about landing this deal, it is feasible to pursue a more aggressive price target.",

We will be selecting a technology solution to replace the existing Cisco 891 router, the ASR1004 head end gear, and the existing inline NAC solution.  In addition, we will be deploying wireless LAN to all of the Agent offices.  AmFam will be selecting a vendor to procure the equipment and deploy the technology solution.  At the conclusion of the RFP process we will award a contract.  Additional Information: AmFam has 3,000 agent offices throughout 19 states that will be affected.  We desire to implement a reasonable security protection capability within each office, however, we would like to retain the current Netgear FS728 switches deployed in each office.  Long term, we expect the Netgear will be phased out as we move to a predominantly wireless office.  Use of Aruba ClearPass is desired as the back end authentication system.

The pricing for the ?Professional and Educational Services? were noted to be Above FMV.  Pricing Analysis ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions.   Workforce Budgeting & Analytics Kronos has a large footprint at REI, but even in the context of larger spend the pricing is very good and appears historical pricing has carried to the current proposal before contract consolidation next year. ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be FMV.  o\tWhile Kronos does not publish list pricing, NPI has numerous deals in our database providing the ability to make comparisons, and by our estimates, your quote is discounted at ~80%+ which NPI considers to be solidly FMV. ?\tMarket range is typically between $.8 and $1.5 so clearly REI is getting solid pricing given these are add-on purchases.

Kronos rack rates start at $200 per hour (blended). ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be Above FMV. ?\tCurrently, your blended hourly rate stands at ~$213, which we would expect for someone with far less of a landscape than what REI has. o\tNPI provided target discounts as shown in the table below, returning a nominal additional savings of $1,078 (blended rate of ~$180).

Indicate that you have done your market research (talking to colleagues, or a new REI executive who has experience with Kronos consulting), and you were expecting a blended rate closer to $175 - $180 per hour and to match prior contracts.  ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially for the add-on subscriptions. While that is evident in the subscription add-on, there is room for improvement on hourly rates.   Determined licenses were FMV but install rates were above FMV with targets provided",

During normal renewal cycles, these companies historically do not move and typically raise prices that are not locked in, anywhere from 3-8% year over year.  In fact, I just finished a review, for a large Midwest Bank, that has been a customer of NICE Systems for some 8 years, , and with the exception of last year, when they did a major upgrade, and the first two renewals, where they had contractually agreed to maintenance, NICE raised their rates every year. Why not last year, because they did a major upgrade. Fast forward 365 days to this renewal, absolutely no love what so ever, 3% increase, across the board, that was the extent of their favoritism.  I have reviewed both your prior and current offers. The original offer at 60% was actually not a bad starting position, considering the size of your environment, although, the 3% increase on maintenance right out of the gate and the maintenance rate based on an initial 22% were both above FMV for certain. The 2nd iteration, at 63% discount and a flat maintenance rate, is definitely a step in the right direction. Keep it up.   The goal here should be to get closer to 70%, but that is not going to happen now and it is most likely not going to happen quickly. AFI missed the end of Q2, so you may have to hold 60-70 days to get all the way to 69-70% and it is going to take competition. Even if NICE has been eliminated, they have to be played up. Aceyus is another vendor that you can work into the conversation as is Cisco.   We can help you brainstorm and set this in motion if you need assistance.",

On Premise model and have been through a few rounds of pricing.  Attached is a breakdown of where we ended up.  Can you benchmark the ?Current? pricing.  They came down on licensing, Professional Services and of course Support and Maintenance from the first pricing breakdown also included on the attached.  Thanks for your help.  No interest in SaaS. Asked about that discount to capture it   Seemed to say he had a verbal for 70% on perpetual but Mike did review and landed at 63%.  From Pat: Revised quote is forthcoming but the one you posted is the latest.   The difference will be a license fees drop from $400K to $367, Support and Maintenance drops from $264K over 3 years to $220,200 and Professional Services drops from $125K (estimated) to $112.5  Yes, this is the key stuff; perpetual current state.  We did look at SaaS and it is cost prohibitive mostly because both Verint and Nices? solution are not true SaaS.  They both essentially are hosted in their own environment.
