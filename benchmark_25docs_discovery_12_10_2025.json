        "current_narrative": "Although the initial discounts offered by Dell EMC are respectable, NPI considers other external factors when classifying pricing and those areas should be considered in this negotiation.  NPI would typically expect to see both Hardware and Software discounted at 70% - 72% for deal of this size. Discounting at 69.5% places this pricing in the high range (and almost above FMV). ? Due to the timing of this fiscal year-end opportunity, NPI has increased the FMV target discount an additional percentage point, up to 73%. Achieving this target will result in approximately $51K in savings. ? Support is typically 20% of net HW/SW pricing for THREE years. In this offer, NPI finds that the support pricing is at 21% of HW/SW pricing, but only covers TWO years. \u00a92017 NPI, LLC. All Rights Reserved. NPI Confidential Information. May Not Be Disclosed to 3rd Parties. Page 3 ? NPI adjusted for this anomaly and increases the target discount to 82% of list for support. This discount results in a number that extrapolates out to 21% for the typical three-year term. Successfully negotiating this topic will result in approximately $39K in savings. ? Professional services is a rarely discounted line item and NPI finds that the small discounts that are seen are typically found in large deployments with large amounts of professional services. o NPI believes that these funds ARE somewhat flexible and because of the small dollar amount, NPI is applying the 23% discount that we periodically find in larger deployments to this proposal. Although this equates to a small $2K in savings, NPI mentions it as another negotiation point for Michael Kors.",

        "current_narrative": "Findings and Recommendations NPI reviewed REI?s Kronos proposal and found the pricing for the add-on software subscriptions to be Fair Market Value (FMV) based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the ?Professional and Educational Services? were noted to be Above FMV.  Pricing Analysis ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions.   Workforce Budgeting & Analytics Kronos has a large footprint at REI, but even in the context of larger spend the pricing is very good and appears historical pricing has carried to the current proposal before contract consolidation next year. ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be FMV.  o\tWhile Kronos does not publish list pricing, NPI has numerous deals in our database providing the ability to make comparisons, and by our estimates, your quote is discounted at ~80%+ which NPI considers to be solidly FMV. ?\tMarket range is typically between $.8 and $1.5 so clearly REI is getting solid pricing given these are add-on purchases.

Kronos rack rates start at $200 per hour (blended). ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be Above FMV. ?\tCurrently, your blended hourly rate stands at ~$213, which we would expect for someone with far less of a landscape than what REI has. o\tNPI provided target discounts as shown in the table below, returning a nominal additional savings of $1,078 (blended rate of ~$180).

Indicate that you have done your market research (talking to colleagues, or a new REI executive who has experience with Kronos consulting), and you were expecting a blended rate closer to $175 - $180 per hour and to match prior contracts.  ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially for the add-on subscriptions. While that is evident in the subscription add-on, there is room for improvement on hourly rates.   Determined licenses were FMV but install rates were above FMV with targets provided",

This did not lend itself to a full FMV document, but if you need a more formal document, I can put something together for you.  ?\tOverall, the discounting on years 1 & 2, at ~39% is some of the best discounting we?ve seen.  This is a Corporate VP level discount within Microsoft. o\tWe have other, larger Microsoft clients that are not able to get to that discount level. o\tWe suspect that a combination of a) your relatively low dollar commit, b) only purchasing Core CAL?s, and c) Chico?s next big purchase will be in 2-years with the EA renewal, makes Chico?s a ?target for opportunity? within Microsoft.  Microsoft will be looking to significantly increase the revenue they get from Chico?s, either by adding on new products, or significantly reducing your discount levels at the time of the EA renewal. ?\tIt is common that Microsoft is trying to ramp down the 3rd year discount to 20%.  NPI recommends that you push hard for consistency across all 3-years. ?\tYou will want to be sure to have a ?Not to Exceed? (NTE) clause added to this contract so that the renewal cost does not exceed either CPI or CAGR.  We recommend that you target a NTE 3% increase (over 3-years), but Microsoft will most likely settle on 6% - 10%. ?\tChico?s is receiving solid additional funding in Deployment Funds, CSM, and Fast Track, etc.  There may be even more funding available, but Chico?s would have to tie it to some specific project.  So, overall, Year 1 & 2 pricing are very good.  We recommend that you push for 3rd year consistency and add the NTE.  At that point, Chico?s could move forward with confidence on this purchase.",

        "current_narrative": "Although the initial discounts offered by Dell EMC are respectable, NPI considers other external factors when classifying pricing and those areas should be considered in this negotiation.  NPI would typically expect to see both Hardware and Software discounted at 70% - 72% for deal of this size. Discounting at 69.5% places this pricing in the high range (and almost above FMV). ? Due to the timing of this fiscal year-end opportunity, NPI has increased the FMV target discount an additional percentage point, up to 73%. Achieving this target will result in approximately $51K in savings. ? Support is typically 20% of net HW/SW pricing for THREE years. In this offer, NPI finds that the support pricing is at 21% of HW/SW pricing, but only covers TWO years. \u00a92017 NPI, LLC. All Rights Reserved. NPI Confidential Information. May Not Be Disclosed to 3rd Parties. Page 3 ? NPI adjusted for this anomaly and increases the target discount to 82% of list for support. This discount results in a number that extrapolates out to 21% for the typical three-year term. Successfully negotiating this topic will result in approximately $39K in savings. ? Professional services is a rarely discounted line item and NPI finds that the small discounts that are seen are typically found in large deployments with large amounts of professional services. o NPI believes that these funds ARE somewhat flexible and because of the small dollar amount, NPI is applying the 23% discount that we periodically find in larger deployments to this proposal. Although this equates to a small $2K in savings, NPI mentions it as another negotiation point for Michael Kors.",

We will be selecting a technology solution to replace the existing Cisco 891 router, the ASR1004 head end gear, and the existing inline NAC solution.  In addition, we will be deploying wireless LAN to all of the Agent offices.  AmFam will be selecting a vendor to procure the equipment and deploy the technology solution.  At the conclusion of the RFP process we will award a contract.  Additional Information: AmFam has 3,000 agent offices throughout 19 states that will be affected.  We desire to implement a reasonable security protection capability within each office, however, we would like to retain the current Netgear FS728 switches deployed in each office.  Long term, we expect the Netgear will be phased out as we move to a predominantly wireless office.  Use of Aruba ClearPass is desired as the back end authentication system.

        "current_narrative": "Findings and Recommendations NPI reviewed REI?s Kronos proposal and found the pricing for the add-on software subscriptions to be Fair Market Value (FMV) based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the ?Professional and Educational Services? were noted to be Above FMV.  Pricing Analysis ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions.   Workforce Budgeting & Analytics Kronos has a large footprint at REI, but even in the context of larger spend the pricing is very good and appears historical pricing has carried to the current proposal before contract consolidation next year. ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be FMV.  o\tWhile Kronos does not publish list pricing, NPI has numerous deals in our database providing the ability to make comparisons, and by our estimates, your quote is discounted at ~80%+ which NPI considers to be solidly FMV. ?\tMarket range is typically between $.8 and $1.5 so clearly REI is getting solid pricing given these are add-on purchases.

Kronos rack rates start at $200 per hour (blended). ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be Above FMV. ?\tCurrently, your blended hourly rate stands at ~$213, which we would expect for someone with far less of a landscape than what REI has. o\tNPI provided target discounts as shown in the table below, returning a nominal additional savings of $1,078 (blended rate of ~$180).

Indicate that you have done your market research (talking to colleagues, or a new REI executive who has experience with Kronos consulting), and you were expecting a blended rate closer to $175 - $180 per hour and to match prior contracts.  ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially for the add-on subscriptions. While that is evident in the subscription add-on, there is room for improvement on hourly rates.   Determined licenses were FMV but install rates were above FMV with targets provided",

The second quote combines both and the total costs are listed as monthly fees.  We are looking for a one year contract that will be rolled up in our SaaS agreement next year.  During that time we will look at some multi-year options to see where we can leverage some cost saving.  The first quote is to install Analytics only.

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for checking in, and thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  I ran this past our Microsoft team and we have a bit of feedback for you.  This did not lend itself to a full FMV document, but if you need a more formal document, I can put something together for you.  ?\tOverall, the discounting on years 1 & 2, at ~39% is some of the best discounting we?ve seen.  This is a Corporate VP level discount within Microsoft. o\tWe have other, larger Microsoft clients that are not able to get to that discount level. o\tWe suspect that a combination of a) your relatively low dollar commit, b) only purchasing Core CAL?s, and c) Chico?s next big purchase will be in 2-years with the EA renewal, makes Chico?s a ?target for opportunity? within Microsoft.  Microsoft will be looking to significantly increase the revenue they get from Chico?s, either by adding on new products, or significantly reducing your discount levels at the time of the EA renewal. ?\tIt is common that Microsoft is trying to ramp down the 3rd year discount to 20%.  NPI recommends that you push hard for consistency across all 3-years. ?\tYou will want to be sure to have a ?Not to Exceed? (NTE) clause added to this contract so that the renewal cost does not exceed either CPI or CAGR.  We recommend that you target a NTE 3% increase (over 3-years), but Microsoft will most likely settle on 6% - 10%. ?\tChico?s is receiving solid additional funding in Deployment Funds, CSM, and Fast Track, etc.  There may be even more funding available, but Chico?s would have to tie it to some specific project.  So, overall, Year 1 & 2 pricing are very good.  We recommend that you push for 3rd year consistency and add the NTE.  At that point, Chico?s could move forward with confidence on this purchase.",

We are not incorporating Storefront in 2018 but have requested the vendor to offer a recoup of those paid costs with the knowledge that we were not using the services in 2017.   I have attached our former agreement along with a renewal proposal for your reference.   Are you able to assist? If so, what is your expected turn around on the request?   Update - we have decided to opt for a one year deal with the assumption that our business will change over the next year. With that, we may not engage your services on this one. Due to the substantial savings we obtained on the prior agreement I don't anticipate, nor do I expect, they will be in a position offer additional savings for a one year renewal.

        "current_narrative": "When it comes to Verint (or NICE or Aceyus or any other major IVR player), you have two opportunities to get your pricing right, new purchases, and significant upgrades, and that is it. During normal renewal cycles, these companies historically do not move and typically raise prices that are not locked in, anywhere from 3-8% year over year.  In fact, I just finished a review, for a large Midwest Bank, that has been a customer of NICE Systems for some 8 years, , and with the exception of last year, when they did a major upgrade, and the first two renewals, where they had contractually agreed to maintenance, NICE raised their rates every year. Why not last year, because they did a major upgrade. Fast forward 365 days to this renewal, absolutely no love what so ever, 3% increase, across the board, that was the extent of their favoritism.  I have reviewed both your prior and current offers. The original offer at 60% was actually not a bad starting position, considering the size of your environment, although, the 3% increase on maintenance right out of the gate and the maintenance rate based on an initial 22% were both above FMV for certain. The 2nd iteration, at 63% discount and a flat maintenance rate, is definitely a step in the right direction. Keep it up.   The goal here should be to get closer to 70%, but that is not going to happen now and it is most likely not going to happen quickly. AFI missed the end of Q2, so you may have to hold 60-70 days to get all the way to 69-70% and it is going to take competition. Even if NICE has been eliminated, they have to be played up. Aceyus is another vendor that you can work into the conversation as is Cisco.   We can help you brainstorm and set this in motion if you need assistance.",

On Premise model and have been through a few rounds of pricing.  Attached is a breakdown of where we ended up.  Can you benchmark the ?Current? pricing.  They came down on licensing, Professional Services and of course Support and Maintenance from the first pricing breakdown also included on the attached.  Thanks for your help.  No interest in SaaS. Asked about that discount to capture it   Seemed to say he had a verbal for 70% on perpetual but Mike did review and landed at 63%.  From Pat: Revised quote is forthcoming but the one you posted is the latest.   The difference will be a license fees drop from $400K to $367, Support and Maintenance drops from $264K over 3 years to $220,200 and Professional Services drops from $125K (estimated) to $112.5  Yes, this is the key stuff; perpetual current state.  We did look at SaaS and it is cost prohibitive mostly because both Verint and Nices? solution are not true SaaS.  They both essentially are hosted in their own environment.  Got a revised quote (mike excel). Quantities changed a little and support was uplifted but generally ended as-is.",

Discounting is poor in each category for a $2M+ annual spend, and the 0% discount on subscription items is consistent with a 0% rate on subscriptions in Freddie Mac?s larger EAS. The SCE does provide some automatic discounting on perpetual licensing, but at this size of a net spend across multiple agreements, those discounts do not push pricing into the range of FMV.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI strongly recommends not mentioning specific discounts off the Level C reference pricing.  Microsoft is notorious for standing up to requests that solely revolve around discounts; they are typically much more receptive when clients speak to the larger 3-year TCO plus address the financial exposure risks of the SCE?s encompassing licensing rules. ?\tNPI recommends getting Microsoft to focus on an even budgetary goal of getting the spend under a $6.75M target for the term ($2.25M annual) in exchange for an expedited deal approval that preserves a March signature timeline. ?\tNPI notes that these targets are more conservative to reflect the smaller timeframe available for this deal.  o\tMore aggressive targets would be appropriate with multiple months available for negotiations, but NPI has seen success even within shorter periods.  o\tIf Freddie Mac feels the sales team is especially nervous about landing this deal, it is feasible to pursue a more aggressive price target.",

With a current blended discount of 65.7%, VSP is within FMV, but we have seen slightly better discounting and we believe VSP should target 68% for 2,000 Nodes, returning an additional ~$6K in savings.   The message to Chef should focus on dollar figures vs discount percentages.  It is a more convincing argument to explain to Chef that you are trying to reach a budgetary number of $82,250 (using a specific number makes it seem more realistic).  You may be able to rob from Peter to pay Paul and add some additional dollars to the budget for this project, but we are unlikely to get to $94K.  If Chef can meet us in the middle around $85K, approval will likely happen quicker.  NPI is interested in the negotiations that have occurred to this point with Chef?  What has VSP done & said to reach the current 65.7% blended discount?  In sum, NPI feels this pricing is within FMV as is, but 68% is achievable and would be closer to best-in-class.",

We are not incorporating Storefront in 2018 but have requested the vendor to offer a recoup of those paid costs with the knowledge that we were not using the services in 2017.   I have attached our former agreement along with a renewal proposal for your reference.   Are you able to assist? If so, what is your expected turn around on the request?   Update - we have decided to opt for a one year deal with the assumption that our business will change over the next year. With that, we may not engage your services on this one.

I would also like to note that our team paid for Storefront services in 2017 for all brands (carved out by the vendor in the amount of $60k). We are not incorporating Storefront in 2018 but have requested the vendor to offer a recoup of those paid costs with the knowledge that we were not using the services in 2017.   I have attached our former agreement along with a renewal proposal for your reference.   Are you able to assist? If so, what is your expected turn around on the request?   Update - we have decided to opt for a one year deal with the assumption that our business will change over the next year. With that, we may not engage your services on this one. Due to the substantial savings we obtained on the prior agreement I don't anticipate, nor do I expect, they will be in a position offer additional savings for a one year renewal. Let me converse with Mark Wheeler first and I will get back to you.",

During the review process, NPI came to understand that many of these resources have a higher/niche/product specific skill set.  Based on this understanding, the target rates we provided are not best-in-class rates but Fair Market Value rates.  For example, for a junior developer in the CA Sunnyvale area, we have seen rates as low as $60 for resources with 0-2 years. However, this may not be a realistic target for Intuit.  NPI recommended a $75 target for IT services - Jr. Developer assuming the resource has 3-6 years of experience and higher skill set and a $80 target for Product development Jr. Developer which requires special product related knowledge.",
