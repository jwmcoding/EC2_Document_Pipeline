Upon review, we determined your current pricing to be FMV as you should feel confident in moving forward.   ?\tAs it stands, your quantity of 8,450 puts you in 8th pricing group (5,001 ? 10,000).  o\tPricing does get better as you move up groups but there is an obvious increased multiplier making the overall cost higher. o\tSince your initial TAPADS purchase in 2016, your YoY increase has consistently remained at ~1%.

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for checking in, and thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  I ran this past our Microsoft team and we have a bit of feedback for you.  This did not lend itself to a full FMV document, but if you need a more formal document, I can put something together for you.  ?\tOverall, the discounting on years 1 & 2, at ~39% is some of the best discounting we?ve seen.  This is a Corporate VP level discount within Microsoft. o\tWe have other, larger Microsoft clients that are not able to get to that discount level. o\tWe suspect that a combination of a) your relatively low dollar commit, b) only purchasing Core CAL?s, and c) Chico?s next big purchase will be in 2-years with the EA renewal, makes Chico?s a ?target for opportunity? within Microsoft.  Microsoft will be looking to significantly increase the revenue they get from Chico?s, either by adding on new products, or significantly reducing your discount levels at the time of the EA renewal. ?\tIt is common that Microsoft is trying to ramp down the 3rd year discount to 20%.  NPI recommends that you push hard for consistency across all 3-years. ?\tYou will want to be sure to have a ?Not to Exceed? (NTE) clause added to this contract so that the renewal cost does not exceed either CPI or CAGR.  We recommend that you target a NTE 3% increase (over 3-years), but Microsoft will most likely settle on 6% - 10%. ?\tChico?s is receiving solid additional funding in Deployment Funds, CSM, and Fast Track, etc.  There may be even more funding available, but Chico?s would have to tie it to some specific project.  So, overall, Year 1 & 2 pricing are very good.  We recommend that you push for 3rd year consistency and add the NTE.  At that point, Chico?s could move forward with confidence on this purchase.",

        "current_narrative": "Cindy and Dan chimed in a bit.  Cindy on pricing and Dan on the agreement.  Largely got feedback from Dean who worked their original EA.  Email back: Hi Deidre,- I had a few folks scan and chime in.  Our collective observations: ?\tThe Product Number for QC5-00002 has not changed since last year but the description has.  The price continues to be $1.50 so no change since last year or from this Feb to March.   The new name is AzureInfoProtPremP1 ShrdSvr ALNG SubsVL MVL PerUsr.  It appears they don?t sell Rights Management as an individual SKU any longer. ?\tLevel D List is $1.50 under EA and $1.70 under Select.  It can also be bought under their CSP (Cloud Solutions Program) but NPI doesn?t have that Level d list price. ?\tThe 3R2-00002 product hasn?t changed and is still $4.49.  Perhaps they quoted that if it is on your current EA and the QC5 was overlooked due to the name change. ?\tI?m attaching the file you sent with Level D list prices confirmed.  ?\tPlease note the Windows Skus are PER YEAR vs. the others on here that are per month.  I provided both the platform and non-platform option but the price they listed of 37.92 is the platform price. ?\tYou will run up against some challenges since each country is buying in their own currency o\tEach country has a different price list and you can?t take the US price list and use the latest exchange rate to come up with the right list price for a given country. This is because pricing is set at some point in the past based on an historical exchange rate.  Some will work in Metlife?s favor and some will not. o\tThey will each have their respective Level D pricing so there?s a common goal.  As you suggest 1,500 is too small of a commitment to expect a discount. NPIs FMV expectation is 0% off. If Metlife commits to some rollout up to around 5,000 agents we could see up to a 10% discount being possible.  Also, 20,000 agents + would have a 20-30% discount target.  o\tWe don?t think the Japan O365 rollout will help the non-captive agents piece.  I?m assuming you were talking about that vs. Japan buying non-captive agent licenses.  We believe MS will point to rev rec limitations and balk at reducing any set pricing that?s been negotiated for Japan.   o\tIn some countries Microsoft abstracts themselves from the customer. A partner negotiates with a customer and then negotiated with Microsoft. There?s a disconnect and MS expects to get a certain amount and partners are given some pricing latitude.  Japan, Brazil and Mexico are indirect countries. In these countries you have moving parts of the exchange rate and the indirectness. o\tFor direct countries, the goal is Level D in their currency.  ?\tAlso, one of our MS folks shared this: the participation agreement permits the entity that signed the agreement to include non-affiliated entities in their enterprise device/user counts.  A participation agreement is typically used when the parent entity (the ?enrolled affiliate?) has the ability to direct standards for the participants/franchisees/etc.  The enrolled affiliate is responsible both for placing orders for the participant (commonly outsourced to the reseller), and they are responsible for paying the bill.  Microsoft does not invoice the individual participants.",

        "current_narrative": "Pat My advisor believes the Equinix offers are at list price for both Chicago and DC.   The DC 2 data center is their main hub and there?s not much remaining space there which makes them less negotiable.  Chicago is another story.  List pricing is above FMV.  Target 25-30% off all MRCs and settling on anything about 20% is solid plus target no installation costs in Chicago.  While you may want to push for that in DC it?ll be tougher.  You may want to consider indicating you know DC is their hub and your intel suggests has limited capacity and because of that you can live with minimal discounting BUT 0% across the board is not going to work.  Then push for 10% on DC and the targets I noted for Chicago.  This is new business for Equinix with cheaper options so they can flex if pushed.  A few other thoughts:  There are two power models in the industry.  Measured Use (pay by amp used) and flat rated to a limit.  AmFam has chosen kVA based power which has flat rated AC power to a 3 KVa limit per term. There are significant penalties if you exceed the kVa limit during the 36 month term.  AmFam needs to understand the initial consumption of the equipment going in to the cabinet and its future growth.  See below on contractual items.  The NRC cost for each AC circuit is $500.  Power is primary and redundant so a total of 4 circuits.    Power                   NRC                       MRC (primary & redundant) Chicago                $500.00                 $362.50/cabinet                                $1,087.50/cage Ashburn               $500.00                 $300.00/cabinet                                $900.00/cage                        Interconnection Each cage will be configured with a 10 gb port accessible to the public internet/cloud.  NRC is $3,000 per port.  This a bundled offer including the port and cross-connect and cable.   There is no mention of redundancy in the port.    Potential Risks  1]            Make sure 3 cabinets and 3 kVa is sufficient for the 36 month term of the contract.    2]            Make sure the interconnection port is redundant. We assume one IBX location is primary and the other DR.  3]            This is not a fixed price contract.  There is a 5% annual price escalator on all prices.     TCO Summary                                 NRC                       36 months          Total  Chicago                 $5,500                   $89,846                 $95,346  Ashburn               $5,500                   $75,660                 $81,160  Total                      $11,000                 $165,506              $176,506   Here are three other ideas for AmFam to consider:  1]           Reduce the 5% fixed annual escalator:   Eliminate/reduce the escalator on the cage MRC of $300 (Ashburn) and $362 (Chicago).  Equinix space costs are fixed (investment in the building is sunk).  Plus, they keep adding cabinets so they cover their costs at the marginal rate of another cabinet.  This is very similar to another software license?no increase in underlying cost but increased revenue.   Second, on the other hand, power is an external variable not completely under their control.   In that case, I would index the power to a third party index.  I used the CPI index.   BLS publishes CPI values on urban basis and both Chicago and Washington have their own index.  Equinix will have language available for indexing and AmFam should ask for it and compare 5% to what they propose as an index.   National CPI over the last 3 years is much lower than 5% annually.    2]           Up front $3000 interconnection fee:  The old model was a monthly interconnect charge which has been replaced through competition to a NRC.  A interconnection MRC was ?frustrating? as it was viewed by the customer as a charge for a 50 foot piece of cable (I?m exaggerating here).  Amortized over the 36 month term, this works out to $83 MRC for a 10 gb port with no traffic charge.  This is a good price but AmFam needs to ask what the charge will be to use Equinix services to interconnect with cloud providers (say Azure, AWS, etc) or a third party ISP (say AT&T, VZ) for internet access.   So, make sure the port is redundant and make sure you understand third party external interconnect costs.  The port is a gate to the outside world?..charges for what goes through the gate may be additional.  3]           Hedge for growth:  Three cabinets/cage seems small, but maybe that?s all AmFam can forecast right now.   Consider including a hedge this way.  Reserve on a no-cost basis 2 additional cabinets per cage (build the cage larger).  If they grow past the initial 3 cabinets anytime during the term, they can draw down on the 2 reserved cabinets.  All cabinets will then have a reduction in MRC by some negotiated MRC.  AmFam is working with a small requirement so Equinix probably will not want to negotiate this (if they don?t grow, Equinix has 2 stranded cabinet spaces).   AmFam nevertheless should reserve and hedge now to the best you can.",

        "current_narrative": "In summary, the proposed pricing from Adobe is at the low end of the range of Fair Market Value as compared to similar market transactions.  NPI reviewed the original Adobe Analytics purchase for Intuit (In June 2016).  Adobe had proposed pricing of $28 for 90 Billion server calls and $25 for 100 Billion server calls per year. NPI had recommended targets of $25 for 90 billion server calls and $23 for 100 billion server calls which targets Intuit achieved at the time resulting in savings of $233K for 1 year.  In a subsequent renewal early last year, the pricing has remained flat at $23 for 100 Billion server calls.  Adobe Analytics Changes   Adobe previously offered Analytics in two editions, standard and premium.  ?\tAdobe has repackaged the Analytics Cloud (announced March 2017) and now offers three editions: Select, Prime and Ultimate. The license metric continues to be Million SERVER CALLS Per Month. Each product increases in functionality and price from Select to Prime to Ultimate. ?\tPreviously, secondary calls cost 50% of Primary server calls, but that is no longer the case. Now, both primary and secondary calls have the same cost and count towards the total calls. ?\tAdobe increased the price for all of their analytics solutions this year when they introduced the three new analytics products. ?\tBased on Intuit's usage of Adobe Analytics and price point, Intuit has been offered the Prime product for this renewal.  Price Breakdown     ?\tIt is common for Adobe to offer pricing tiers like the offered table for companies to project their spend as they grow.  Typically Adobe will offer 3 options - they have offered seven options in this proposal, which is generous.   ?\tIntuit is being offered great pricing on Adobe Analytics Prime. This pricing is likely to have had not only management exception approval but also executive approval. Intuit?s Adobe rep likely had to fight a battle internally to get this pricing approved.    Recommendation ?\tOverall, NPI believes that Intuit has received great pricing from Adobe for the Analytics Prime and the pricing has remained flat since 2016/2017.  ?\tThe Sitecat Data Feed is priced at $1,350 CPMM. NPI recommends a pricing of $1250 CPMM which translates to savings of $14,400 per year. ?\tAt this level of spend, Intuit can request free training and free passes to Adobe Summit.  FINAL UPDATE: Great news, we were able to negotiate our pricing further to 21.25 for 120B primary server calls (price intended for 150B) and continue to pay 11.50 for secondary postponing the increase in price for secondary.

        "current_narrative": "Provided feedback via email (see attached)  Thanks for sending over the quote for our review. NPI has provided general feedback as well as specific price targets for your 3-year renewal.  They changed the company name from AtTask to Workfront (http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/attask-changes-its-name-to-workfront-inc-300023764.html) in 2015 to rebrand and grow. Workfront has been aggressive, raising prices significantly over the past several years.  ?\tWorkfront acquired ProofHQ in 2015 (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/workfront-acquires-proofhq-300116669.html)  While Workfront does not publish list pricing, they have provided it in Shaw?s quote (see table below for math).  Workfront Flex License ?  ?\tThe ?Flex? License allows for Workfront customers to seamlessly transfer access within an organization, not always offered by account executives as it is a cross between the highest tier ?Plan? license (all inclusive) and lower tier ?Work? license (less inclusive). This indicates Shaw?s need for licenses to change hands as people may leave/change departments as they no longer require access to Workfront. The Flex license is also flexible in capabilities as changing employees may not need the full use of a certain license type but is still available. Flex licenses are offered at a lower list price but with limited discounting ? most likely due to customers not always leveraging the full benefits of the higher tier (?Work? is half the cost of ?Plan? license).  o\tDoes Shaw need the flexibility? As it does come at a cost - it can makes sense to use Flex if you have more Work licenses than Plan. It is to Shaw?s advantage if you are able to make full use of the Flex license.  o\tIf this is not the case for Shaw?s Workfront landscape, you could inquire for a quote using one license type or the other to see how pricing compares. ?\tNPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms. We believe this longer commitment should be rewarded. o\tFor this deal size and term NPIs FMV target is 30%. FYI, we would expect a one-year term to top out at 10% and a two-year near 20%. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of $10,560.  ProofHQ Premium License ?  ?\tNPI calculated a current discount of 20% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting driven by the same reasoning as the Flex license.  We often see both types of licenses discounted similarly. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of a modest $1,700. ?\tNPI provided a comparison of Premium vs Standard below, where if Shaw does not require the Premium benefits you could consider the lower cost Standard or Select offerings. Shaw could consider the threat or really consider a less expensive license. o\tSee ?Pricing? section (no pricing provided, but compares license types) ? https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/workfront-review/   The Premium offering includes:  ?\tTheir highest level of license and security  ?\tEncryption-at-rest  ?\tOption to review data center audits performed to maintain SaS70 compliance  ?\tUnlimited access to providing Requests, Dashboards and Reports ? users beyond the licensed ?Power users?  ?\tHighest level of support, 7X24X365  ?\tProvides for data storage of 25GB per user ?\tHighest level of SLA at 30 Min ? 4 hours  The Standard offering by comparison:  ?\tDoes not include their highest security, Encryption-at-rest (EAR)  ?\tProvides for their lowest level of SLA?s (2 hours - 2 business days for support response)  ?\tProvides their lowest level of support offering 12 hours per day, 5 days per week (12X5)  ?\tProvides for data storage of 1.5GB per user  ?\tSomewhat limited where non-power users are unable to submit requests to a queue.

        "customer_comments": "***Updated proposal received with new feedback provided. See the attached files labeled 'UPDATED...'  While the Flex license quantities have remained the same (55), Shaw has been proposed a more expensive ?Enterprise Flex License? ? reflecting a list price increase of 50% from the previous $1,200 unit list to the current $1,800 unit list price. ?\tThe ?Workfront Enterprise Flex License? was previously offered as the ?Workfront Flex-Planned Work License?. This improved license offers expanded functionalities, granting users access to all features of the application including standard work management, resource planning, proofing, reporting, etc. o\tIt is to Shaw?s advantage to make full use of the Flex license as you are paying for the ability to use both license types.  In consideration of the increase in overall spend and 3 year contract term, NPI views current pricing as Above FMV. NPI suggests targeting a discount of 35% with reasonable fallback of 25% to 30%.  ?\tSimilar to before, NPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms. We believe this longer commitment should be rewarded. o\tAchieving a target discount of 35% returns an additional savings of ~$20K. o\tAchieving a target discount of 25% returns an additional savings of ~$10K.

We have only seen a handful of BrightEdge transactions, but I was able to do some comparative analysis on the discount percentage.  Overall, last year?s purchase at 40% discounting is well within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV) for a BrightEdge purchase of this size.  We have actually seen a few larger BrightEdge deals that have maxed out in the mid- 40%?s discounting, so we consider 40% for a $60K list price purchase to be FMV.  Since BrightEdge has held the pricing flat AND included additional Domains and Google Analytics connects, NPI continues to believe that this pricing is well within FMV.  VSP can move forward with confidence on this one.",

        "current_narrative": "In summary, the proposed pricing from Adobe is at the low end of the range of Fair Market Value as compared to similar market transactions.  NPI reviewed the original Adobe Analytics purchase for Intuit (In June 2016).  Adobe had proposed pricing of $28 for 90 Billion server calls and $25 for 100 Billion server calls per year. NPI had recommended targets of $25 for 90 billion server calls and $23 for 100 billion server calls which targets Intuit achieved at the time resulting in savings of $233K for 1 year.  In a subsequent renewal early last year, the pricing has remained flat at $23 for 100 Billion server calls.  Adobe Analytics Changes   Adobe previously offered Analytics in two editions, standard and premium.  ?\tAdobe has repackaged the Analytics Cloud (announced March 2017) and now offers three editions: Select, Prime and Ultimate. The license metric continues to be Million SERVER CALLS Per Month. Each product increases in functionality and price from Select to Prime to Ultimate. ?\tPreviously, secondary calls cost 50% of Primary server calls, but that is no longer the case. Now, both primary and secondary calls have the same cost and count towards the total calls. ?\tAdobe increased the price for all of their analytics solutions this year when they introduced the three new analytics products. ?\tBased on Intuit's usage of Adobe Analytics and price point, Intuit has been offered the Prime product for this renewal.  Price Breakdown     ?\tIt is common for Adobe to offer pricing tiers like the offered table for companies to project their spend as they grow.  Typically Adobe will offer 3 options - they have offered seven options in this proposal, which is generous.   ?\tIntuit is being offered great pricing on Adobe Analytics Prime. This pricing is likely to have had not only management exception approval but also executive approval. Intuit?s Adobe rep likely had to fight a battle internally to get this pricing approved.    Recommendation ?\tOverall, NPI believes that Intuit has received great pricing from Adobe for the Analytics Prime and the pricing has remained flat since 2016/2017.  ?\tThe Sitecat Data Feed is priced at $1,350 CPMM. NPI recommends a pricing of $1250 CPMM which translates to savings of $14,400 per year. ?\tAt this level of spend, Intuit can request free training and free passes to Adobe Summit.  FINAL UPDATE: Great news, we were able to negotiate our pricing further to 21.25 for 120B primary server calls (price intended for 150B) and continue to pay 11.50 for secondary postponing the increase in price for secondary. Thank you!",

We have only seen a handful of BrightEdge transactions, but I was able to do some comparative analysis on the discount percentage.  Overall, last year?s purchase at 40% discounting is well within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV) for a BrightEdge purchase of this size.  We have actually seen a few larger BrightEdge deals that have maxed out in the mid- 40%?s discounting, so we consider 40% for a $60K list price purchase to be FMV.  Since BrightEdge has held the pricing flat AND included additional Domains and Google Analytics connects, NPI continues to believe that this pricing is well within FMV.  VSP can move forward with confidence on this one.",

        "current_narrative": "Provided feedback via email (see attached)  Thanks for sending over the quote for our review. NPI has provided general feedback as well as specific price targets for your 3-year renewal.  They changed the company name from AtTask to Workfront (http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/attask-changes-its-name-to-workfront-inc-300023764.html) in 2015 to rebrand and grow. Workfront has been aggressive, raising prices significantly over the past several years.  ?\tWorkfront acquired ProofHQ in 2015 (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/workfront-acquires-proofhq-300116669.html)  While Workfront does not publish list pricing, they have provided it in Shaw?s quote (see table below for math).  Workfront Flex License ?  ?\tThe ?Flex? License allows for Workfront customers to seamlessly transfer access within an organization, not always offered by account executives as it is a cross between the highest tier ?Plan? license (all inclusive) and lower tier ?Work? license (less inclusive). This indicates Shaw?s need for licenses to change hands as people may leave/change departments as they no longer require access to Workfront. The Flex license is also flexible in capabilities as changing employees may not need the full use of a certain license type but is still available. Flex licenses are offered at a lower list price but with limited discounting ? most likely due to customers not always leveraging the full benefits of the higher tier (?Work? is half the cost of ?Plan? license).  o\tDoes Shaw need the flexibility? As it does come at a cost - it can makes sense to use Flex if you have more Work licenses than Plan. It is to Shaw?s advantage if you are able to make full use of the Flex license.  o\tIf this is not the case for Shaw?s Workfront landscape, you could inquire for a quote using one license type or the other to see how pricing compares. ?\tNPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms. We believe this longer commitment should be rewarded. o\tFor this deal size and term NPIs FMV target is 30%. FYI, we would expect a one-year term to top out at 10% and a two-year near 20%. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of $10,560.  ProofHQ Premium License ?  ?\tNPI calculated a current discount of 20% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting driven by the same reasoning as the Flex license.  We often see both types of licenses discounted similarly. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of a modest $1,700. ?\tNPI provided a comparison of Premium vs Standard below, where if Shaw does not require the Premium benefits you could consider the lower cost Standard or Select offerings. Shaw could consider the threat or really consider a less expensive license. o\tSee ?Pricing? section (no pricing provided, but compares license types) ? https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/workfront-review/   The Premium offering includes:  ?\tTheir highest level of license and security  ?\tEncryption-at-rest  ?\tOption to review data center audits performed to maintain SaS70 compliance  ?\tUnlimited access to providing Requests, Dashboards and Reports ? users beyond the licensed ?Power users?  ?\tHighest level of support, 7X24X365  ?\tProvides for data storage of 25GB per user ?\tHighest level of SLA at 30 Min ? 4 hours  The Standard offering by comparison:  ?\tDoes not include their highest security, Encryption-at-rest (EAR)  ?\tProvides for their lowest level of SLA?s (2 hours - 2 business days for support response)  ?\tProvides their lowest level of support offering 12 hours per day, 5 days per week (12X5)  ?\tProvides for data storage of 1.5GB per user  ?\tSomewhat limited where non-power users are unable to submit requests to a queue.

        "customer_comments": "***Updated proposal received with new feedback provided. See the attached files labeled 'UPDATED...'  While the Flex license quantities have remained the same (55), Shaw has been proposed a more expensive ?Enterprise Flex License? ? reflecting a list price increase of 50% from the previous $1,200 unit list to the current $1,800 unit list price. ?\tThe ?Workfront Enterprise Flex License? was previously offered as the ?Workfront Flex-Planned Work License?. This improved license offers expanded functionalities, granting users access to all features of the application including standard work management, resource planning, proofing, reporting, etc. o\tIt is to Shaw?s advantage to make full use of the Flex license as you are paying for the ability to use both license types.  In consideration of the increase in overall spend and 3 year contract term, NPI views current pricing as Above FMV. NPI suggests targeting a discount of 35% with reasonable fallback of 25% to 30%.  ?\tSimilar to before, NPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms. We believe this longer commitment should be rewarded. o\tAchieving a target discount of 35% returns an additional savings of ~$20K. o\tAchieving a target discount of 25% returns an additional savings of ~$10K.

        "current_narrative": "Smita has some data that shows the daily rate is slightly less than what we have seen from Verint before.  However, the overall blended rate for this project is $244 / hour.  This is largely because the lowest cost resource is at $225/hour.  From their input, it appear they have a lot of business with Verint and use them either extensively or exclusively for professional services.  Asking for a 10% loyalty discount across the board is not unwarranted.  Other observation.  The resources on this project are a bit skewed.  The PM represents 25.8% of the time, the Solution Delivery Architect represents 22.6%.  This seems very high for both.  We would expect a project like this might only have 10 ? 15% participation by these two resources and the balance divided between the application consultant and systems engineer.  Re-juggling the balance of resources doesn?t really impact the overall cost though since the sdev of rates is only $24/hour.   To Client: Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  We have seen a number of Verint proposals, many that include professional services so I was able to do some comparative analysis.  The information below did not lend itself to a full FMV report, but if you need this info in a more formal document, I can put that together for you, just let me know.  The feedback on this consultant pricing is mixed: ?\tFrom a high-level perspective looking at the daily rates, this is in line with what we have seen from Verint.  So at a high-level, this pricing is within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV).  However, ?. ?\tBased on your description of the amount of work that VSP has done with Verint, NPI is also looking at the breakdown of hourly rates for this SOW: o\tThe overall blended hourly rate for this project is $240/hr, which NPI considers to be a little higher than FMV.  A portion of the ?higher than FMV? determination may have something to do with the number of hours for some of the resources ? more on that below. o\tThe App Consultant and System Engineer are both at $225/hr.  With the amount of spend that VSP has with Verint, NPI believes these rates are a bit high.  We recommend targeting an hourly rate closer to $200/hr, $1600/day. o\tThe hourly rate for the Project Manager is $237.50, which NPI considers to be a bit higher than FMV.  The hourly rate for the PM should be reduced a bit to $220 - $225 per hour or $1800/day. o\tThe Solution Architect is priced at $275/hr which NPI also considers to be above FMV for a company with VSP?s Verint spend.  A rate closer to $240 - $250 ($2K/day) would be more in line with market rate. o\tUsing the target hourly rates above, with the same number of days for each resource, the total price tag would be closer to $54K for this SOW. ?\tAnother observation that NPI found is that the resources on this project seem to be a bit skewed, based on the resource make-up that we have seen on similar projects for other clients.   o\tThe PM represents 25.4% of the time, the Solution Delivery Architect represents 23.8%.  This seems very high for both.  We would expect a project like this might only have 10 ? 15% participation by these two resources and the balance divided between the application consultant and systems engineer.  NPI recommends that VSP inquire with Verint on this and verify the need for this level of effort for these resources (at these prices).  If it makes sense to reduce the hours for these 2 resources, it could affect overall pricing since these are the most expensive resources.",

For example, for a junior developer in the CA Sunnyvale area, we have seen rates as low as $60 for resources with 0-2 years. However, this may not be a realistic target for Intuit.

        "current_narrative": "Provided feedback via email (see attached)  Thanks for sending over the quote for our review. NPI has provided general feedback as well as specific price targets for your 3-year renewal.  They changed the company name from AtTask to Workfront (http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/attask-changes-its-name-to-workfront-inc-300023764.html) in 2015 to rebrand and grow. Workfront has been aggressive, raising prices significantly over the past several years.  ?\tWorkfront acquired ProofHQ in 2015 (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/workfront-acquires-proofhq-300116669.html)  While Workfront does not publish list pricing, they have provided it in Shaw?s quote (see table below for math).  Workfront Flex License ?  ?\tThe ?Flex? License allows for Workfront customers to seamlessly transfer access within an organization, not always offered by account executives as it is a cross between the highest tier ?Plan? license (all inclusive) and lower tier ?Work? license (less inclusive). This indicates Shaw?s need for licenses to change hands as people may leave/change departments as they no longer require access to Workfront. The Flex license is also flexible in capabilities as changing employees may not need the full use of a certain license type but is still available. Flex licenses are offered at a lower list price but with limited discounting ? most likely due to customers not always leveraging the full benefits of the higher tier (?Work? is half the cost of ?Plan? license).  o\tDoes Shaw need the flexibility? As it does come at a cost - it can makes sense to use Flex if you have more Work licenses than Plan. It is to Shaw?s advantage if you are able to make full use of the Flex license.  o\tIf this is not the case for Shaw?s Workfront landscape, you could inquire for a quote using one license type or the other to see how pricing compares. ?\tNPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms. We believe this longer commitment should be rewarded. o\tFor this deal size and term NPIs FMV target is 30%. FYI, we would expect a one-year term to top out at 10% and a two-year near 20%. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of $10,560.  ProofHQ Premium License ?  ?\tNPI calculated a current discount of 20% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting driven by the same reasoning as the Flex license.  We often see both types of licenses discounted similarly. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of a modest $1,700. ?\tNPI provided a comparison of Premium vs Standard below, where if Shaw does not require the Premium benefits you could consider the lower cost Standard or Select offerings. Shaw could consider the threat or really consider a less expensive license. o\tSee ?Pricing? section (no pricing provided, but compares license types) ? https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/workfront-review/   The Premium offering includes:  ?\tTheir highest level of license and security  ?\tEncryption-at-rest  ?\tOption to review data center audits performed to maintain SaS70 compliance  ?\tUnlimited access to providing Requests, Dashboards and Reports ? users beyond the licensed ?Power users?  ?\tHighest level of support, 7X24X365  ?\tProvides for data storage of 25GB per user ?\tHighest level of SLA at 30 Min ? 4 hours  The Standard offering by comparison:  ?\tDoes not include their highest security, Encryption-at-rest (EAR)  ?\tProvides for their lowest level of SLA?s (2 hours - 2 business days for support response)  ?\tProvides their lowest level of support offering 12 hours per day, 5 days per week (12X5)  ?\tProvides for data storage of 1.5GB per user  ?\tSomewhat limited where non-power users are unable to submit requests to a queue.

        "customer_comments": "***Updated proposal received with new feedback provided. See the attached files labeled 'UPDATED...'  While the Flex license quantities have remained the same (55), Shaw has been proposed a more expensive ?Enterprise Flex License? ? reflecting a list price increase of 50% from the previous $1,200 unit list to the current $1,800 unit list price. ?\tThe ?Workfront Enterprise Flex License? was previously offered as the ?Workfront Flex-Planned Work License?. This improved license offers expanded functionalities, granting users access to all features of the application including standard work management, resource planning, proofing, reporting, etc. o\tIt is to Shaw?s advantage to make full use of the Flex license as you are paying for the ability to use both license types.  In consideration of the increase in overall spend and 3 year contract term, NPI views current pricing as Above FMV. NPI suggests targeting a discount of 35% with reasonable fallback of 25% to 30%.  ?\tSimilar to before, NPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms. We believe this longer commitment should be rewarded. o\tAchieving a target discount of 35% returns an additional savings of ~$20K. o\tAchieving a target discount of 25% returns an additional savings of ~$10K.

        "current_narrative": "Here are some thoughts on the SAS renewal:  NPI has observed that SAS is a vendor who likes to keep customers in the dark about their pricing.  They have different list pricing depending on the volume of spend and they are very inconsistent in the pricing they will agree to.  What this does tell us is that SAS pricing is highly negotiable.  We know that test environments are typically 25% of the production costs and list prices for Dev and Test are based on a percentage of the list price for the production environment.  There doesn?t seem to be quite enough information in this proposal (email) for NPI to provide a detailed benchmark.  Below are some thoughts and recommendations that VSP will want to consider.  ?\tAt first blush, the descriptions in the email you attached aren?t detailed enough for us to be able to calculate list price.  Additionally, there are no productions fees in the email description, so we are not able to determine list price and discount percentages for the Dev and Test environments.  If we have better descriptions of the licenses or - better still - if we have SKUs we can usually figure out list price and discount percentages for FYFs.  Having said that, Dev and Test environments list pricing tends to be a percentage of the production costs.  NOTE: NPI strongly recommends that you ask for list price on the FYFs so we can be sure we have the correct discount percentage.  SAS will share list price if pushed. ?\tWe like to see the first-RYF to be between 27-35% of the FYF.  VSP is at 28% for both the Dev and Test licenses, so that is good, however:   o\tWe still want to gauge the discount of the FYF fees even though we like 28% for the RYF. Often we see that a good RYF percentage is due to the first year fee is not well discounted. ?\tWe also like to see the third year fee to be 3% over the second year fee.  SAS has offered 5%.  That?s a standard starting offer.  Target 3%. ?\tHow big is VSPs overall footprint with SAS?  Can you provide financial details around your production environment?  That helps us adjust our targeted discount for this particular transaction.  It is largely handled standalone by SAS but the big picture should be considered especially if it benefits VSPs. ?\tThe professional services rates are actually very good in the SOW.  We usually don?t see large market variances in SAS professional services rates. o\tThe technical consultant is billed at $195. We see market rates between $195 - $200 per hour. o\tTechnical architects typically bill at $225 per hour. o\tThe Project Manager is billed at $180. We typically see this at $200 per hour.  If you can provide a bit more detail, I am confident that we can offer more detailed analysis of your SAS pricing.",

The majority of the spend falls under XIV storage, with XIV hardware (26%) and software (39%) comprising the majority of the spend (65%).  That ratio goes up further (71%) if Technical Advisors related to XIV are included (6%).  Analyzing hardware in this space requires greater granular configuration data for the equipment covered and can be an exacting process.  BJC?s configuration data may sway FMV analysis slightly, but there are sufficient commoditized hardware, software, and service items in the provided spreadsheet to complete a more exacting assessment.  Current price increases over the previous 5-Year term are within FMV guidelines that target anything lower than 5% annual, with BJC?s totals at nearly 4% when comparing previous and current 5-year totals.  While the overall spend is within FMV guidelines, XIV and Pseries hardware are ripe for third-party maintainers once assets are off initial support, and as a result IBM faces pricing pressure in the current market.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Kronos and found the pricing for the core SaaS bundle to be above Fair Market Value (FMV) with room for improvement of up to 24% based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the other add-on software subscriptions are at FMV.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions. ?\tThe core SaaS bundle is priced at $2.74 per employee, per month (PEPM). The list pricing for this bundle is $7 PEPM, which is an increase from the previous list price of $5 PEPM.  o\tFor 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $1.82 PEPM. This translates to savings of $13,800 per month. ?\tThe Workforce Activities software is priced at $0.45 PEPM. This price is at Fair Market Value (FMV). ?\tThe Workforce Accruals software is priced at $0.26, which is also at FMV. ?\t The Workforce Record Manager is priced at $0.15. For 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $0.11 PEPM. This translates to savings of $600 per month. ?\tWF Analytics is priced at $0.86 PEPM. This price is FMV. ?\tThe overall savings based on NPI?s recommended target price translates to $14,400 per month and $358,560 for the 36-month period with a 24-month ramp up.  Other considerations: ?\tNPI has not seen Kronos insist on prepayment for the subscriptions. This is certainly negotiable. ?\tHowever, NPI has also not seen Kronos concede to a ramp up pricing, which reduces the revenue in years 1 and 2.  o\tMost SaaS vendors prefer an even annual or front-loaded pricing/revenue model and a 3-5 year commitment.  A ramp up licensing scenario inevitably results in higher pricing per license for the customer and higher TCO over 5 years. However, if a customer has strong leverage (for example, if the customer already has perpetual licenses and does not need the licenses since they don?t require upgrades, and therefore would not be likely to make the purchase at all, or if there is competition in the mix), the vendor will concede to these terms. ?\tA target of $2 per employee per month for Time and Accruals for 15,000 employees is achievable. The motivation by Kronos to provide a larger incentive for a large employee base is in line with their marketing approach, which highly touts the number of users/employees that use or are managed through KRONOS cloud. ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially on the add-on subscriptions.",

Upon review, we determined your current pricing to be FMV as you should feel confident in moving forward.   ?\tAs it stands, your quantity of 8,450 puts you in 8th pricing group (5,001 ? 10,000).  o\tPricing does get better as you move up groups but there is an obvious increased multiplier making the overall cost higher. o\tSince your initial TAPADS purchase in 2016, your YoY increase has consistently remained at ~1%.  Year\tTotal\tIncrease 2016\t$105,158\tN/A 2017\t$106,629\t1.4% 2018\t$107,830\t1.1%  ?\tPlatinum Support is at ~10% of license spend and is considered FMV. o\tProofpoint will include Platinum Support at no charge when bought as SaaS, but not otherwise. This is the case with the current quote and past reviews performed by NPI. This is something to consider as it could result in significant savings across your current landscape.

If CAMC really wants to gain the attention of Proofpoint, you should consider a multi-year agreement. In NPI?s experience, CAMC could reduce the year over year costs by as much as 35% with a multi-year commitment with the right messaging and timing.",

        "current_narrative": "Here are some thoughts on the SAS renewal:  NPI has observed that SAS is a vendor who likes to keep customers in the dark about their pricing.  They have different list pricing depending on the volume of spend and they are very inconsistent in the pricing they will agree to.  What this does tell us is that SAS pricing is highly negotiable.  We know that test environments are typically 25% of the production costs and list prices for Dev and Test are based on a percentage of the list price for the production environment.  There doesn?t seem to be quite enough information in this proposal (email) for NPI to provide a detailed benchmark.  Below are some thoughts and recommendations that VSP will want to consider.  ?\tAt first blush, the descriptions in the email you attached aren?t detailed enough for us to be able to calculate list price.  Additionally, there are no productions fees in the email description, so we are not able to determine list price and discount percentages for the Dev and Test environments.  If we have better descriptions of the licenses or - better still - if we have SKUs we can usually figure out list price and discount percentages for FYFs.  Having said that, Dev and Test environments list pricing tends to be a percentage of the production costs.  NOTE: NPI strongly recommends that you ask for list price on the FYFs so we can be sure we have the correct discount percentage.  SAS will share list price if pushed. ?\tWe like to see the first-RYF to be between 27-35% of the FYF.  VSP is at 28% for both the Dev and Test licenses, so that is good, however:   o\tWe still want to gauge the discount of the FYF fees even though we like 28% for the RYF. Often we see that a good RYF percentage is due to the first year fee is not well discounted. ?\tWe also like to see the third year fee to be 3% over the second year fee.  SAS has offered 5%.  That?s a standard starting offer.  Target 3%. ?\tHow big is VSPs overall footprint with SAS?  Can you provide financial details around your production environment?  That helps us adjust our targeted discount for this particular transaction.  It is largely handled standalone by SAS but the big picture should be considered especially if it benefits VSPs. ?\tThe professional services rates are actually very good in the SOW.  We usually don?t see large market variances in SAS professional services rates. o\tThe technical consultant is billed at $195. We see market rates between $195 - $200 per hour. o\tTechnical architects typically bill at $225 per hour. o\tThe Project Manager is billed at $180. We typically see this at $200 per hour.  If you can provide a bit more detail, I am confident that we can offer more detailed analysis of your SAS pricing.",
