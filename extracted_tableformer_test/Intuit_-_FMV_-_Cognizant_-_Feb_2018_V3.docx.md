Vendor Overview Cognizant is an American-headquartered multinational corporation whose main competitors include the likes of Infosys, Wipro, HCL, TCS and other IT Consulting firms with a global delivery model. Originally founded as an in-house technology unit of Dun & Bradstreet in 1994, Cognizant started serving external clients in 1996. It made an IPO in 1998, after a series of corporate splits and restructures of its parent companies.

--- Chunk 4 ---
It was the first software services firm listed on the NASDAQ. Cognizant’s revenues grew by leaps and bounds in the 2000s, with revenues around $137 Million in 2000, growing to $14.8 Billion in 2017. In 2017, Cognizant’s revenue grew 10% even as its headcount fell by 200. In IT Consulting companies, growth typically marches hand-in-hand with headcount increases, so this is a first in the industry.

--- Chunk 5 ---
The industry trend is moving from Labor arbitrage to Automation (Technology) arbitrage to improve both revenue per employee and overall margins.
