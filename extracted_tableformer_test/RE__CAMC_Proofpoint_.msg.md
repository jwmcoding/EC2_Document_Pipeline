Subject: RE: CAMC Proofpoint From: Stuart Hunt To: Rich Staas <rstaas@npifinancial. com> Date: 2018-03-07 21:12:59.685000+00:00 --- Email Body --- Checked with Mike and he was good with a stamp of FMV, he sent over the previous quotes not in SFDC so noted ~1% increase. See below for write up. Let me know of any changes to be made Hey, Thanks for sending over your quote. Upon review, we determined your current pricing to be FMV as you should feel confident in moving forward.

--- Chunk 1 ---
* As it stands, your quantity of 8,450 puts you in 8th pricing group (5,001 – 10,000). * Pricing does get better as you move up groups but there is an obvious increased multiplier making the overall cost higher. * Since your initial TAPADS purchase in 2016, your YoY increase has consistently remained at ~1%. Year Total Increase 2016 $105,158 N/A 2017 $106,629 1.4% 2018 $107,830 1.1% * Platinum Support is at ~10% of license spend and is considered FMV.

--- Chunk 2 ---
* Proofpoint will include Platinum Support at no charge when bought as SaaS, but not otherwise. This is the case with the current quote and past reviews performed by NPI. This is something to consider as it could result in significant savings across your current landscape.

If CAMC really wants to gain the attention of Proofpoint, you should consider a multi-year agreement. In NPI’s experience, CAMC could reduce the year over year costs by as much as 35% with a multi-year commitment with the right messaging and timing. Thanks and let us know if you would like to discuss further, Stuart From: Rich Staas Sent: Wednesday, March 7, 2018 11:42 AM To: Stuart Hunt <shunt@npifinancial.
