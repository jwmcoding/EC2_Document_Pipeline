        "current_narrative": "Hi Jennifer, Thanks for sending your add-on license purchase for review.  I see Aspect is using the same negotiation tactic as they did in 2016 where they started with a 30% discount and ended with 40%.  That purchase had an extended list price of $300K for licenses while this purchase is at $235K.  The 5% uplift is possible as our last review for Aspect was right at the end of 2017 and Aspect doesn?t publish a price list.  That 2017 review had list prices that matched the ones being shown/offered to Progressive.   They hadn?t raised their prices in a couple of years and my guess is just before your last purchase in 2016 there had been a recent 10% increase.  The Aspect story has changed little: they?ve moved from leader to niche player in the latest Gartner report (Feb 2018), mainly focused on existing clients.  Progressive in effect are investing dollars into the enhancement of a SaaS solution you don't own.  My SME advises postponing the buy if possible (maybe not feasible) and survey the market for better solution and a lower TCO.  Of course, this is a mouthful and easier said than done.  However, it could generate some talking points in support of your negotiation.  Ask about the R&D into the perpetual license solution.  The talent on the R&D and Support side can?t be focused on Progressive?s solution.  Push hard for specifics.  Has the release schedule slowed down?  Less in each release?  Any more major releases expected?  While leverage may not be on your side, this allows you to push for better pricing on this as you double your footprint.  It just makes common sense.  If they indicate less R&D and fewer releases then why are they trying to raise prices.  Feels like they are milking the old product while they furiously work on their SaaS offering.   Focusing back on the commercial terms, we continue to expect to see Mission Critical Maintenance at 22% and Business Day Maintenance at 20%.  This is where Progressive landed in 2016 and that?s the current offer.  It is small dollars but you?d kind of expect the gap to be bigger i.e., Business Day to be 18% vs. MC at 22%; however, they?ve been consistent.  Along the same negotiation points noted above, if Progressive feels as though support is deteriorating and software releases are less robust and fewer and far between that is reason enough to push for a lower percentage.  Maintenance costs are comprised of phone support and software releases and patches so if any aspect is weakening then customers have the right to push for relief.  During our last review we noted that they just emerged from bankruptcy and were struggling to rollout  a cloud offering.  We suggested a 50%+ target but the leverage worked against Progressive and you topped off at 40%.  This feels like a rinse-and-repeat scenario.  40% feels a bit low in light of market conditions and the 2x growth.  NPI suggests targeting a 50% final discount which typically requires pushing for more than that to allow for the compromise.  Achieving a 50% discount drives $23,500 out of license spend and about $3,500 out of support. Driving Mission Critical support to 20% would save an additional $2500.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Kronos and found the pricing for the core SaaS bundle to be above Fair Market Value (FMV) with room for improvement of up to 24% based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the other add-on software subscriptions are at FMV.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions. ?\tThe core SaaS bundle is priced at $2.74 per employee, per month (PEPM). The list pricing for this bundle is $7 PEPM, which is an increase from the previous list price of $5 PEPM.  o\tFor 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $1.82 PEPM. This translates to savings of $13,800 per month. ?\tThe Workforce Activities software is priced at $0.45 PEPM. This price is at Fair Market Value (FMV). ?\tThe Workforce Accruals software is priced at $0.26, which is also at FMV. ?\t The Workforce Record Manager is priced at $0.15. For 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $0.11 PEPM. This translates to savings of $600 per month. ?\tWF Analytics is priced at $0.86 PEPM. This price is FMV. ?\tThe overall savings based on NPI?s recommended target price translates to $14,400 per month and $358,560 for the 36-month period with a 24-month ramp up.  Other considerations: ?\tNPI has not seen Kronos insist on prepayment for the subscriptions. This is certainly negotiable. ?\tHowever, NPI has also not seen Kronos concede to a ramp up pricing, which reduces the revenue in years 1 and 2.  o\tMost SaaS vendors prefer an even annual or front-loaded pricing/revenue model and a 3-5 year commitment.  A ramp up licensing scenario inevitably results in higher pricing per license for the customer and higher TCO over 5 years. However, if a customer has strong leverage (for example, if the customer already has perpetual licenses and does not need the licenses since they don?t require upgrades, and therefore would not be likely to make the purchase at all, or if there is competition in the mix), the vendor will concede to these terms. ?\tA target of $2 per employee per month for Time and Accruals for 15,000 employees is achievable. The motivation by Kronos to provide a larger incentive for a large employee base is in line with their marketing approach, which highly touts the number of users/employees that use or are managed through KRONOS cloud. ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially on the add-on subscriptions.",

        "current_narrative": "Hey Robert, Prior to you sending the revised Safenet offer we had taken some time to try and find all the list prices as they weren?t provided in the quote.  That history can be helpful as you continue negotiations. The prior two offers were at poor discounts of 0-2%.  We couldn?t validate a couple of items.  They have a crazy number of SKUs complicated by a series of acquisitions (Aladdin, Safenet, Gemalto, and Thales (who also own competitor Vormetric)).  I?m attaching our efforts which can be found in the first worksheet.  The feedback was going to be this looks to be budgetary (we hope) and Webster should insist that list prices be provided and also ask for list prices for tiers below and above the quantities you are buying for the Tokenization Manager licenses.  The ?2? at the end of the SKU refers to the second volume tier 11-20.    The recent quote had different SKUs.  Again, I think we figured out the list prices but it requires some art and science.  The two prior quotes totaled about $300K.  The latest is around $700K.  The discount appears to have increased to just under 12%.  See the second worksheet in the Excel file.  I believe all the three-year maintenance items list for 24% of the hw/sw list cost each year and are discounted the same 12% (so they remain at 24% of the NET cost).  Plus Maintenance is priced at 24% and Extended Maintenance (not what Webster is buying) is priced at 18%.  I suggest Webster ask for list prices to validate NPIs figures.  If NPIs list prices are incorrect we?ll want to revisit this review.  At this spend level and in a competitive environment, 30% would be the minimum discount NPI suggests Webster should target and 40%-50% is not an unrealistic goal.  NPI hasn?t seen a ton of SafeNet deals but have seen several smaller ones that landed in the mid to high 20s making 30% our floor.  We have fewer data points on the top end.  We?ve seen a million plus purchase comprised largely of subscriptions at over 60%.  This purchase has a different dollar profile and product mix but it helped to form our ceiling.  NPI can?t provide a narrower target than 35-50% as our estimate of FMV.  With confidence we believe anything under 30% is NOT FMV.  Anything into the 50s at this dollar size feels stellar and a great outcome.  That leaves the wide swath of 30-50%.  Based on our data and this sizable purchase I bumped up the bottom of the range to 35%.  The goal would be to keep Maintenance at the same 24% of the net spend with a best case outcome of 22%.  NPI has seen SafeNet discount hw/sw considerably more than Maintenance.  I?ve included the math supporting our low and high targets in the second worksheet.  If we get any more late-breaking data points I?ll share that info.",

Should BJC pursue the B2C option and shift the licensing structure for portions of the spend, NPI notes that more aggressive FMV pricing targets would exist compared to similar transformational agreements.  BJC?s precedent pricing in this space holds a good foundation and does not support much targeted cost savings on the BAU renewal, especially considering concessions made around costs for existing Spectrum licenses.  New demand around Watson, DashDB, Cloud subscriptions and other analytics items are the main area where pricing came in above FMV, holding the greatest area of savings opportunity in either option.  Given the limited timeframe, savings targets for the BAU renewal remain conservative.  The B2C proposal as offered is not as aggressive compared to other NPI reviews of this like, and if BJC pursues this option, utilizing an even $1.5M budgetary figure would move the spend further into FMV ranges.  IBM?s fiscal year end in December means that any lingering business without definite indications of a close will have teams at Sirius and the vendor under pressure from executives, especially if they believe budgetary restrictions jeopardize the deal.",
        "customer_comments": "BJC?s BAU renewal option holds some FMV savings targets, but with a short timeframe you should feel confident executing.  Aggressive targets around B2C are shown as that current offer does lag behind similar conversions NPI reviews in this space.    ?\tTargeting a $1.8M and $1.5M for the BAU and B2C offers, respectively, matches FMV discounting and may be tied to even budgetary amounts, enhancing the credibility of messaging.    o\tLeading with these net targets as amounts to hit in order to facilitate a quick signature will utilize existing pressure around the fiscal quarter ends in December.",

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  I have had this one for a while and I owe you some feedback.  Since this was a smaller deal and you were out of the office, it got moved a little lower on the priority list.  Typically Oracle renewals are not very exciting.  Often, the best case scenario for a standard Oracle renewal is to have pricing remain flat from the previous year, which is what Oracle is offering in the 18-month proposal.  So NPI considers the 18-month renewal cost to be Fair Market Value (FMV).  In the 24-month and 36-month renewals, Oracle is offering additional discounting on the Multi-tenant service, but the Java CS is maintained at a 30% discount.  NPI sees no reason that the Java service should not also see moderate reductions (or increased discounting) if CNL is going to make a longer-term commitment.  NPI recommends targeting 35% discounting on the Java CS service for the 24-month renewal ? a reduction of ~$2K.  And we recommend targeting 40% discounting on the Java CS service for the 36-month renewal ? a reduction of ~$5K.  The messaging to Oracle is fairly simple, if CNL is going to make a longer-term commitment, it will need to be worth-your-while.  If there is no reduction in the largest cost of this renewal when we make a longer-term commitment, then we may as well just renew for 1-year and see if we will still need these services each year.   UPDATE: Closing as CNL no longer a client.",

The pricing for the other add-on software subscriptions are at FMV.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions. ?\tThe core SaaS bundle is priced at $2.74 per employee, per month (PEPM). The list pricing for this bundle is $7 PEPM, which is an increase from the previous list price of $5 PEPM.  o\tFor 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $1.82 PEPM. This translates to savings of $13,800 per month. ?\tThe Workforce Activities software is priced at $0.45 PEPM. This price is at Fair Market Value (FMV). ?\tThe Workforce Accruals software is priced at $0.26, which is also at FMV. ?\t The Workforce Record Manager is priced at $0.15. For 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $0.11 PEPM. This translates to savings of $600 per month. ?\tWF Analytics is priced at $0.86 PEPM. This price is FMV. ?\tThe overall savings based on NPI?s recommended target price translates to $14,400 per month and $358,560 for the 36-month period with a 24-month ramp up.  Other considerations: ?\tNPI has not seen Kronos insist on prepayment for the subscriptions. This is certainly negotiable. ?\tHowever, NPI has also not seen Kronos concede to a ramp up pricing, which reduces the revenue in years 1 and 2.  o\tMost SaaS vendors prefer an even annual or front-loaded pricing/revenue model and a 3-5 year commitment.  A ramp up licensing scenario inevitably results in higher pricing per license for the customer and higher TCO over 5 years. However, if a customer has strong leverage (for example, if the customer already has perpetual licenses and does not need the licenses since they don?t require upgrades, and therefore would not be likely to make the purchase at all, or if there is competition in the mix), the vendor will concede to these terms. ?\tA target of $2 per employee per month for Time and Accruals for 15,000 employees is achievable. The motivation by Kronos to provide a larger incentive for a large employee base is in line with their marketing approach, which highly touts the number of users/employees that use or are managed through KRONOS cloud. ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially on the add-on subscriptions.",

        "current_narrative": "Hey Robert, Prior to you sending the revised Safenet offer we had taken some time to try and find all the list prices as they weren?t provided in the quote.  That history can be helpful as you continue negotiations. The prior two offers were at poor discounts of 0-2%.  We couldn?t validate a couple of items.  They have a crazy number of SKUs complicated by a series of acquisitions (Aladdin, Safenet, Gemalto, and Thales (who also own competitor Vormetric)).  I?m attaching our efforts which can be found in the first worksheet.  The feedback was going to be this looks to be budgetary (we hope) and Webster should insist that list prices be provided and also ask for list prices for tiers below and above the quantities you are buying for the Tokenization Manager licenses.  The ?2? at the end of the SKU refers to the second volume tier 11-20.    The recent quote had different SKUs.  Again, I think we figured out the list prices but it requires some art and science.  The two prior quotes totaled about $300K.  The latest is around $700K.  The discount appears to have increased to just under 12%.  See the second worksheet in the Excel file.  I believe all the three-year maintenance items list for 24% of the hw/sw list cost each year and are discounted the same 12% (so they remain at 24% of the NET cost).  Plus Maintenance is priced at 24% and Extended Maintenance (not what Webster is buying) is priced at 18%.  I suggest Webster ask for list prices to validate NPIs figures.  If NPIs list prices are incorrect we?ll want to revisit this review.  At this spend level and in a competitive environment, 30% would be the minimum discount NPI suggests Webster should target and 40%-50% is not an unrealistic goal.  NPI hasn?t seen a ton of SafeNet deals but have seen several smaller ones that landed in the mid to high 20s making 30% our floor.  We have fewer data points on the top end.  We?ve seen a million plus purchase comprised largely of subscriptions at over 60%.  This purchase has a different dollar profile and product mix but it helped to form our ceiling.  NPI can?t provide a narrower target than 35-50% as our estimate of FMV.  With confidence we believe anything under 30% is NOT FMV.  Anything into the 50s at this dollar size feels stellar and a great outcome.  That leaves the wide swath of 30-50%.  Based on our data and this sizable purchase I bumped up the bottom of the range to 35%.  The goal would be to keep Maintenance at the same 24% of the net spend with a best case outcome of 22%.  NPI has seen SafeNet discount hw/sw considerably more than Maintenance.  I?ve included the math supporting our low and high targets in the second worksheet.  If we get any more late-breaking data points I?ll share that info.",
