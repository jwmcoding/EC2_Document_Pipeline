        "current_narrative": "Chris, We reviewed Intuit?s renewal pricing from Jive. On the initial purchase in 2015, there were a couple of iterations and the final term was one year for $400K.  It allowed for a first renewal at $420K for 10,000 users and then had language indicating another four renewals wouldn?t increase by more than 5% each year.   NPIs top end target was $40/user/year and Intuit improved upon its initial $48/offer when the deal was finalized. NPI didn?t review last year?s renewal.  Per the terms of the contract this second renewal shouldn?t exceed 105% of $420K or $441K.  The renewal is for essentially the identical subscription and set of features.  It now includes Encryption at Rest and Cloud Private Preview which were separately added in mid-2016.  The base cost is $420K a year or $42 per person (10,000 users) plus $25K for Encryption and $15K for Cloud Private Preview.  Jive is likely not exercising its right to increase costs 5% on the core subscription to offset the added costs of Encryption and Private Preview now that the two contracts have merged.  The annualized cost of Encryption was $50K and $15K for Private Preview when NPI did our initial review in 2016.  NPI never learned the outcome of this add-on purchase but it appears a further reduction of Encryption was received since the renewal is at $25K.  NPI is assuming Encryption landed at $25K and Private Preview at $15K and they are also renewing at a flat cost.  The offer of $460K appears to be flat compared to the prior two years.  This is great since we know Jive has the right to at least increase the core subscription by 5%.  NPI wouldn?t expect a reduction in costs on a flat renewal.  While this isn?t the inaugural term for Private Review on another recent renewal for a client with 7000 users, Cloud Private Preview was included at no charge.  However, in this case this was an add-on to the renewal.  Intuit has already contracted for Private Preview so it can be hard to negotiate those costs out.  The site link below provides some good detail about Private Preview.  Intuit could consider making the case that Private Preview strongly helps Jive thrive and expand at Intuit and push back on the $15K spend.  https://community.jivesoftware.com/docs/DOC-180119",

        "customer_comments": "So this feedback is less about a benchmark and more about sharing the findings from some research we performed.  While we?ve done a ton of Riverbed hardware and support reviews and a few Riverbed SaaS reviews, none of these involved Aternity.  They?re an Israeli company that Riverbed bought toward the end of 2016.  http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-riverbed-acquires-israeli-saas-co-aternity-for-70m-1001142685  https://www.riverbed.com/press-releases/riverbed-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-leading-end-user-experience-monitoring-provider-aternity.html  The punchline is we believe there?s room for substantial savings.  We found it odd that the one year and three year offers were added together by SoftwareOne and that the multi-year offer didn?t reflect any improved discount.   ?\tElavon?s quotes didn?t include list pricing or provide any indication of the discount being offered ?\tIn NPIs experience, Riverbed has offered the same discount levels for hardware, software and SaaS subscriptions ?\tNPI believes we determined the list price for the primary Part Number ? ATNY-SAAS.  We also believe the other two Parts are zero dollar items.  This is an oddly-constructed set of parts as all three line items seem to just restate the same words just in a different order for the most part.  ?\tPart of our efforts were to validate that the two zero dollar items are typically no cost items.  While we found listings on CDW for the ATNY-SAAS product we got no hits at all when searching sites for pricing on the other two products. ?\tAdditionally, NPI has the attached price list from early 2017.  If you search ATNY-SAAS-PTO you will get only one hit for a zero dollar evaluation license.  If you search LIC-ATNY-SAAS you will get no hits.  If you search ATNY-SAAS you get a plethora of hits. o\tThe most interesting observation is the clear volume-based tiers offered by Aternity that don?t appear to be reflected in Elavon?s quote.  o\tThere are 8 volume tiers (they start at 500-999 because the subscription indicates 500 is the minimum quantity you can buy).  The list price at this level is $8.33/mo o\tElavon?s volume of 57,600 (one year volumes multiplied by three) slots into the second highest tier (50,000-99,999) which has a list price of $2.55 o\tElavon?s offer is $6.15.  This is a 26% discount from the lowest tier list price of $8.33. o\tIn February of 2018, NPI provided another client with a review of a purchase that included SaaS subscriptions.  We were able to validate that several list prices provided in that quote matched the same list price in the Feb 2017 attached price list.  While this doesn?t confirm we have the latest price list it provides some support that it is still valid.   ?\tIn addition, to the programmatic reduced list price based on volume, in NPIs experience Elavon should also receive a discount off that.  30% would be a solid (not aggressive) discount target.  The caveat is if there?s some reason Riverbed doesn?t discount Aternity subscriptions similar to other SaaS subscriptions (NPIs recent experience was with SteelCentral AppInternals SaaS Core). ?\tElavon should seek a starting price of $2.55.  Software One may get a bit wily and indicate they need to use the annual volume of 19,200 which has a list price of $3.15 (tier is 10,000-29,999).  Additionally, a discount of 25-35% should be offered especially if this is a first-time purchase.  The table below shows these scenarios, the targets and targeted reductions.  These are quite significant.  While NPI admits to not having performed an Aternity-related review in the past we believe there?s enough findings to support Elavon seeking reductions or at least some rock solid explanations if the current offer is truly a good one.  ?\tNPI also recommends Elavon take a look at past discounts on any recent/prior Riverbed hardware purchases to see the historical discounts offered by Riverbed as this can support current targets. ?\tIt would be interesting to see what list price and discount are  being used to come up with the $6.15 offer. While it is possible the other two parts have list prices >$0 that aren?t being shown I?d push for clear evidence of that. ?\tRiverbed does not offer the best search tool to find partners and see their level within the ecosystem but SoftwareOne may not be the highest partner with Riverbed and this may be evidenced in their offer. http://partnerlocator.riverbed.com/ Searching in Georgia NPI didn?t see SoftwareOne show up in the list.  An even broader search didn?t find a hit either. The levels were Elite, Premier and Authorized.  Ask S1 if they?re a partner and their level.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the updated proposal from SAP for a global rollout. As detailed in the previous FMV report, and as compared to other market transactions, NPI still believes there is room for significant improvement in pricing. The pricing for Compensation, Performance and Succession are now in the range of FMV (with room for small improvement). The pricing for Learning and Employee Central, Workforce Analytics & Planning are still above FMV.  Overall, there is still room for improvement of about $3.6M which would bring the total cost over 5 years to $18.2M which is also closer to Oracle?s proposed pricing of $17.8M.  The table below has more details on the FMV price for the global rollout.  In terms of the concessions,  ?\tthe exchange rights offered are superior to the others we have seen at NPI.   o\tSAP routinely offers exchange rights, but these are usually within product families. o\tWe have seen only one other instance where they offered an exchange right across products.   o\tWe also see exchange rights capped (usually a certain number of users or a certain % of revenue). In this case, SAP has not subject the exchange rights to any caps. ?\tIf Aramark runs SAP ERP, there is greater flexibility to save money. There may be scope for more exchange rights with existing on-premise software. ?\tThe services credit provided is small ($350K) for a $20 M deal. Since SAP will be displacing all the incumbent HCM and learning software, Aramark will incur an additional cost of $3.86M in implementation fees to make this change. Aramark should negotiate additional consulting credit for implementation.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI has seen In the recent past, Altify has used the following discount table (for what? Single product?  Bundles?): 0 > 50 = 5% 51 > 150 = 15% 150 > 300 = 25% 300 > 400 = 32.50% 400 > 1500  = 40%  JCI?s pricing picks up from this point but starts at 41%, which NPI considers to be ABOVE FMV (for clarity, pricing is high, discounting is low).  Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the proposal from Oracle for Hyperion (Oracle Cloud Fusion) Enterprise Planning and Budgeting Cloud Services and Analytics Cloud and found the pricing to be above FMV with room for significant improvement.   Pricing Analysis  Oracle EPBCS  ?\tThe user Saas fee for Oracle Enterprise Planning and Budgeting Cloud Service is proposed at $175 per user per month.  ?\tThe EPBCS subscription lists at $250 per user per month.  ?\tThis translates to a discount of 30%. NPI has seen the market range of discounts for this software vary between 60% and 80% based on the size of the deal and the customer?s leverage.  For a purchase of this size and based on Metlife?s brand, size and spend with Oracle, as well as the (60 month) term of the deal, NPI would expect starting discounts to be 70%. NPI would expect a 30% discount for smaller sized deals of with a 1 year term. ?\tNPI would recommend a best-in-class discount target of 80% which would amount to savings of $4.1M for the 60 month contract. ?\tNPI would expect the test environment licenses as well as the storage discounts to match the per user EPBCS discount of 80%.   Oracle Analytics Cloud for Finance  ?\tOracle has provided deeper discounts of Oracle Analytics Cloud - Enterprise of 59%.  ?\tMonthly subscription price is proposed at $2,460.  ?\tThe subscription lists at $6000 per month. This translates to a discount of 59%. While this is a good starting point, NPI recommends a target discount between 70% and 80% for the subscriptions in this quote as well ?\tAchieving an 80% discount translates to savings of $2,046,265 for this purchase order.   Negotiation Leverage and Strategy  Oracle has siloed sales teams for each family of products which is why Metlife has 2 different quotes even though you are making both purchases at the same time. The sales reps are separately commissioned for the products assigned to them. The sales reps may or may not even know about the other purchases. It is to Oracle?s benefit to keep the sales teams disparate, in order to put a ceiling on the discounts based on the product family.  ?\tThe term of the subscriptions is a great leverage. Sales reps are compensated immediately based on the size of the deal, so a (larger) 60 month deal is more beneficial to the Oracle sales rep. Oracle also likes longer term deals because it locks in recurring revenue for the term of the contract, and Oracle?s revenue grows based on the customer?s growth over the 60 month term. Threat of reducing the term to 12 months , thus reducing the deal size greatly would incent Oracle to provide deeper discounts for a longer term deal. ?\tAsk Oracle to combine the quote (even though it may not be possible) and use the higher combined list price to get greater discount. ?\tUse the large HCM Cloud purchase from 2016 which had a discount of 87% to set the discount expectations for these purchases.  Close out comments: Gregg ? that was exactly it, we put some competition into the mix and we were able to execute by the end of the month.  Discount for EPBCS went up from 30 to 38% and Analytics went up from 58% to 68%.",

Review final pricing to ensure that support lands at 20% of the final hardware and software costs.    Negotiation Leverage and Strategy ?\tIn contrast to the prior negotiation tactics with Ivoxy, NPI recommends that rather than focusing on dollar amounts, SCH should work with Ivoxy and push them for the same discounts as previously received.  Because SCH now has a target discount to strive for, it sets a somewhat innocent target that needs to be met.   ?\tNPI would expect a pushback based on the prior deal was ~ 1 million greater in list pricing.  Reality is that after discounts are applied, the differences are within a few hundred thousand and still warrant discount levels greater than the current 64% on hardware and software. ?\t?New logo? opportunities help drive discounting a little deeper.  This deeper discounting may have occurred in the prior deal.  The position that SCH should maintain is that ?we can still easily choose to play a dual vendor strategy with our storage solutions if we can?t find the right solution at the right price?. ?\tSupport is currently quoted at 23% of the combined hardware and software costs.  NPI recommends that SCH target a 20% of net price of hardware and software. ?\tNetApp Q3 end is 10/31 and a quarter-end deal will typically allow for the best negotiation power with a promise to close this deal in Q3.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Apttus and found the proposal to be in the range of FMV with scope for improvement. ?\tApttus has proposed pricing of $35.25 for the Enterprise CLM edition.  ?\tThe pricing appears to be grandfathered from Aramark?s pricing for Contract Wizard which is one of the key functionalities in Enterprise CLM.  ?\tAramark?s current pricing of $39.75 for Contract Wizard for about 800 users represents a discount of 47%. ?\tFor 1386 users, the discount tier in the 2013 contract is 53% which translates to a price of $35.25 per user per month.  Below is the snapshot of Aramark?s discount tiers in the 2013 MSA.   NPI has seen pricing for Apttus CLM range between $22 and $60. NPI has observed that there is no consistency in pricing and there is large variance in the market. Pricing is not necessarily closely correlated with the purchase volume; it varies based on many factors and depends mainly on the presence of competition (especially at the time of the initial purchase) as well as customer?s requirements and negotiation leverage. NPI recommends target pricing of $33 per user per month for CLM Enterprise. Achieving a target of $33 per user per month translates to savings of $37K annually.  However, the fact that this is largely a renewal and hence there is a lack of competition reduces Aramark?s leverage. NPI also recommends that Aramark ask about tiered pricing and the associated price breaks as well as capped/flat out year pricing.

In addition to including Contract Wizard, which is one of the key functions, but not the only key function in the Enterprise CLM offering, it includes the other components that Aramark currently licenses, plus a good amount more which Aramark may find useful.",

        "customer_comments": "So this feedback is less about a benchmark and more about sharing the findings from some research we performed.  While we?ve done a ton of Riverbed hardware and support reviews and a few Riverbed SaaS reviews, none of these involved Aternity.  They?re an Israeli company that Riverbed bought toward the end of 2016.  http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-riverbed-acquires-israeli-saas-co-aternity-for-70m-1001142685  https://www.riverbed.com/press-releases/riverbed-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-leading-end-user-experience-monitoring-provider-aternity.html  The punchline is we believe there?s room for substantial savings.  We found it odd that the one year and three year offers were added together by SoftwareOne and that the multi-year offer didn?t reflect any improved discount.   ?\tElavon?s quotes didn?t include list pricing or provide any indication of the discount being offered ?\tIn NPIs experience, Riverbed has offered the same discount levels for hardware, software and SaaS subscriptions ?\tNPI believes we determined the list price for the primary Part Number ? ATNY-SAAS.  We also believe the other two Parts are zero dollar items.  This is an oddly-constructed set of parts as all three line items seem to just restate the same words just in a different order for the most part.  ?\tPart of our efforts were to validate that the two zero dollar items are typically no cost items.  While we found listings on CDW for the ATNY-SAAS product we got no hits at all when searching sites for pricing on the other two products. ?\tAdditionally, NPI has the attached price list from early 2017.  If you search ATNY-SAAS-PTO you will get only one hit for a zero dollar evaluation license.  If you search LIC-ATNY-SAAS you will get no hits.  If you search ATNY-SAAS you get a plethora of hits. o\tThe most interesting observation is the clear volume-based tiers offered by Aternity that don?t appear to be reflected in Elavon?s quote.  o\tThere are 8 volume tiers (they start at 500-999 because the subscription indicates 500 is the minimum quantity you can buy).  The list price at this level is $8.33/mo o\tElavon?s volume of 57,600 (one year volumes multiplied by three) slots into the second highest tier (50,000-99,999) which has a list price of $2.55 o\tElavon?s offer is $6.15.  This is a 26% discount from the lowest tier list price of $8.33. o\tIn February of 2018, NPI provided another client with a review of a purchase that included SaaS subscriptions.  We were able to validate that several list prices provided in that quote matched the same list price in the Feb 2017 attached price list.  While this doesn?t confirm we have the latest price list it provides some support that it is still valid.   ?\tIn addition, to the programmatic reduced list price based on volume, in NPIs experience Elavon should also receive a discount off that.  30% would be a solid (not aggressive) discount target.  The caveat is if there?s some reason Riverbed doesn?t discount Aternity subscriptions similar to other SaaS subscriptions (NPIs recent experience was with SteelCentral AppInternals SaaS Core). ?\tElavon should seek a starting price of $2.55.  Software One may get a bit wily and indicate they need to use the annual volume of 19,200 which has a list price of $3.15 (tier is 10,000-29,999).  Additionally, a discount of 25-35% should be offered especially if this is a first-time purchase.  The table below shows these scenarios, the targets and targeted reductions.  These are quite significant.  While NPI admits to not having performed an Aternity-related review in the past we believe there?s enough findings to support Elavon seeking reductions or at least some rock solid explanations if the current offer is truly a good one.  ?\tNPI also recommends Elavon take a look at past discounts on any recent/prior Riverbed hardware purchases to see the historical discounts offered by Riverbed as this can support current targets. ?\tIt would be interesting to see what list price and discount are  being used to come up with the $6.15 offer. While it is possible the other two parts have list prices >$0 that aren?t being shown I?d push for clear evidence of that. ?\tRiverbed does not offer the best search tool to find partners and see their level within the ecosystem but SoftwareOne may not be the highest partner with Riverbed and this may be evidenced in their offer. http://partnerlocator.riverbed.com/ Searching in Georgia NPI didn?t see SoftwareOne show up in the list.  An even broader search didn?t find a hit either. The levels were Elite, Premier and Authorized.  Ask S1 if they?re a partner and their level.",

The CDP world continues to grow at an amazing pace and is expected to become even more competitive (to the benefit of Intuit).    With that said, NPI would agree that your data leader has done a very good job at both negotiating and documenting the journey.  Based on the Segment deals we have seen and extrapolating a bit on the size of this deal, NPI concludes that this deal appears to be solidly Fair Market Value (FMV).  We believe that Intuit can move forward with confidence on this transaction.",

        "description": "CV:No docs yet... requested quote/proposal from Dianne.  Hope all is well! Thank you again for providing the pricing analysis for Adobe Analytics. I have 2 more requests for next week if your team has the capabilities to analyze market pricing for Segment for CDP- event collection/distribution and Tealium for tag management. I?ll send the Tealium request on another email.   We feel comfortable with the final proposal that we received. Our data leader has done an excellent job with the negotiation. However, we want to get your team?s thoughts if there are any negotiation leverage that we haven?t explored based on your customer?s dealings with Segment. Please see below the price negotiation journey that our leader provided. Please let me know if your team has expertise in analyzing CDP providers and if you have any questions. Thank you!     ? Current FY18 rate: $130K for 3M monthly active identifiers (e.g. cookie or authId). Identifier overages are expensive (we owe $70K and may owe as much as $114K by July). Basic enterprise service level. \"Data governance\" package not included (schema validation/enforcement, Lambda transformations, more coming). ? Offer 1 (Dec '17 for SBSEG marketing websites): $815K for 50M monthly active identifiers ? Offer 2 (Feb '18): $1.5M for 360M annual identifiers + \"data governance\" package. Previously Segment only offered monthly plans, and because of our seasonality we pressed for an annual cap instead. However, active identifier pricing is still terrible for planning because we have many anonymous Intuit experiences (marketing websites, invoice payment portal). So we pushed Segment over several conversations to offer annual event volume pricing to meet our needs. ? Offer 3 (Early Mar '18): $1.3M for 50B events + data governance free for 1 year ($300K after) + \"gold account\" service.  ? Offer 4 (Mid Mar '18) ? Segment is asking for 2 year agreement and deal by Apr 1 for the below: ? 3 mos free + overage debt forgiveness till now + \"gold account\" service + data governance free for 2 yrs + upcoming CDP profiles/audience product free for 1 year ($400K after) ? $1.05M for 80B events ? $1.2M for 100B events ? $1.3M for 120B events (for comparison, Intuit estimated 120B events will be sent to Adobe Analytics in FY19)   ? I gave some thoughtful reasons in asking for the following concessions: ? $100K cut off the top volume (120B) ? 1 year deal with Aug 1 start date (Segment really wants July 1 at least for the first year for a revenue recognition reason.) ? Exclude \"identify\" and \"group\" calls from event volumes (these are for setting user profile info, not really tracking events) ? Overage forgiveness for the rest of FY18 (they had only considered overages up until now) ? After a call with their sales team, this is Offer 5 (Mar 23, 2018) which has 4 options, all which include:  ? 126B events (to cover \"identify\" and \"group\" API calls, estimating 5% of calls)  ? Overage debt forgiveness through March (2 options cover the rest of FY18) ? \"Gold account\" high value customer status ? Data governance package included free for the duration of the term ? Profiles/audience product free through Dec 2018. $233K option to license through end of FY19. For 2 year agreements, $400K option for year 2 (this product will likely be priced $700-800K similar to competitors). 1. July 1 start. 13 months for $1.3M (w/ 10.5B extra events to cover July). Overage forgiveness through June. 2. Aug 1 start. 12 month agreement for $1.25M. (Overage fees assessed Apr-Jul, estimated $50K -- no upside over July 1 start) 3. July 1 start. 25 months for $1.3M for first year (w/ 10.5B extra events to cover July), $1.2M for second year (due Aug 1, 2019). Overage forgiveness through June. 4. Aug 1 start. 24 month agreement $1.2M each year. (Overage fees assessed Apr-Jul, estimated $50K)",

        "current_narrative": "NPI has seen In the recent past, Altify has used the following discount table (for what? Single product?  Bundles?): 0 > 50 = 5% 51 > 150 = 15% 150 > 300 = 25% 300 > 400 = 32.50% 400 > 1500  = 40%  JCI?s pricing picks up from this point but starts at 41%, which NPI considers to be ABOVE FMV (for clarity, pricing is high, discounting is low).  Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the proposal from Oracle for Hyperion (Oracle Cloud Fusion) Enterprise Planning and Budgeting Cloud Services and Analytics Cloud and found the pricing to be above FMV with room for significant improvement.   Pricing Analysis  Oracle EPBCS  ?\tThe user Saas fee for Oracle Enterprise Planning and Budgeting Cloud Service is proposed at $175 per user per month.  ?\tThe EPBCS subscription lists at $250 per user per month.  ?\tThis translates to a discount of 30%. NPI has seen the market range of discounts for this software vary between 60% and 80% based on the size of the deal and the customer?s leverage.  For a purchase of this size and based on Metlife?s brand, size and spend with Oracle, as well as the (60 month) term of the deal, NPI would expect starting discounts to be 70%. NPI would expect a 30% discount for smaller sized deals of with a 1 year term. ?\tNPI would recommend a best-in-class discount target of 80% which would amount to savings of $4.1M for the 60 month contract. ?\tNPI would expect the test environment licenses as well as the storage discounts to match the per user EPBCS discount of 80%.   Oracle Analytics Cloud for Finance  ?\tOracle has provided deeper discounts of Oracle Analytics Cloud - Enterprise of 59%.  ?\tMonthly subscription price is proposed at $2,460.  ?\tThe subscription lists at $6000 per month. This translates to a discount of 59%. While this is a good starting point, NPI recommends a target discount between 70% and 80% for the subscriptions in this quote as well ?\tAchieving an 80% discount translates to savings of $2,046,265 for this purchase order.   Negotiation Leverage and Strategy  Oracle has siloed sales teams for each family of products which is why Metlife has 2 different quotes even though you are making both purchases at the same time. The sales reps are separately commissioned for the products assigned to them. The sales reps may or may not even know about the other purchases. It is to Oracle?s benefit to keep the sales teams disparate, in order to put a ceiling on the discounts based on the product family.  ?\tThe term of the subscriptions is a great leverage. Sales reps are compensated immediately based on the size of the deal, so a (larger) 60 month deal is more beneficial to the Oracle sales rep. Oracle also likes longer term deals because it locks in recurring revenue for the term of the contract, and Oracle?s revenue grows based on the customer?s growth over the 60 month term. Threat of reducing the term to 12 months , thus reducing the deal size greatly would incent Oracle to provide deeper discounts for a longer term deal. ?\tAsk Oracle to combine the quote (even though it may not be possible) and use the higher combined list price to get greater discount. ?\tUse the large HCM Cloud purchase from 2016 which had a discount of 87% to set the discount expectations for these purchases.  Close out comments: Gregg ? that was exactly it, we put some competition into the mix and we were able to execute by the end of the month.  Discount for EPBCS went up from 30 to 38% and Analytics went up from 58% to 68%.",

When customers reduce the deal size, Adobe invariably increases the pricing on the products which has not occurred here. ?\tCost reductions achieved including the cost savings from optimizing product count is 21% or $548K for the ETLA. After adjusting for volumes, the savings from reductions in per unit pricing only is 15% or $106K for the term of the ETLA. ?\tThe final product pricing is within FMV for the size of the deal.

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Apttus and found the proposal to be in the range of FMV with scope for improvement. ?\tApttus has proposed pricing of $35.25 for the Enterprise CLM edition.  ?\tThe pricing appears to be grandfathered from Aramark?s pricing for Contract Wizard which is one of the key functionalities in Enterprise CLM.  ?\tAramark?s current pricing of $39.75 for Contract Wizard for about 800 users represents a discount of 47%. ?\tFor 1386 users, the discount tier in the 2013 contract is 53% which translates to a price of $35.25 per user per month.  Below is the snapshot of Aramark?s discount tiers in the 2013 MSA.   NPI has seen pricing for Apttus CLM range between $22 and $60. NPI has observed that there is no consistency in pricing and there is large variance in the market. Pricing is not necessarily closely correlated with the purchase volume; it varies based on many factors and depends mainly on the presence of competition (especially at the time of the initial purchase) as well as customer?s requirements and negotiation leverage. NPI recommends target pricing of $33 per user per month for CLM Enterprise. Achieving a target of $33 per user per month translates to savings of $37K annually.  However, the fact that this is largely a renewal and hence there is a lack of competition reduces Aramark?s leverage. NPI also recommends that Aramark ask about tiered pricing and the associated price breaks as well as capped/flat out year pricing.

In addition to including Contract Wizard, which is one of the key functions, but not the only key function in the Enterprise CLM offering, it includes the other components that Aramark currently licenses, plus a good amount more which Aramark may find useful.",

They?re an Israeli company that Riverbed bought toward the end of 2016.  http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-riverbed-acquires-israeli-saas-co-aternity-for-70m-1001142685  https://www.riverbed.com/press-releases/riverbed-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-leading-end-user-experience-monitoring-provider-aternity.html  The punchline is we believe there?s room for substantial savings.  We found it odd that the one year and three year offers were added together by SoftwareOne and that the multi-year offer didn?t reflect any improved discount.   ?\tElavon?s quotes didn?t include list pricing or provide any indication of the discount being offered ?\tIn NPIs experience, Riverbed has offered the same discount levels for hardware, software and SaaS subscriptions ?\tNPI believes we determined the list price for the primary Part Number ? ATNY-SAAS.  We also believe the other two Parts are zero dollar items.  This is an oddly-constructed set of parts as all three line items seem to just restate the same words just in a different order for the most part.  ?\tPart of our efforts were to validate that the two zero dollar items are typically no cost items.  While we found listings on CDW for the ATNY-SAAS product we got no hits at all when searching sites for pricing on the other two products. ?\tAdditionally, NPI has the attached price list from early 2017.  If you search ATNY-SAAS-PTO you will get only one hit for a zero dollar evaluation license.  If you search LIC-ATNY-SAAS you will get no hits.  If you search ATNY-SAAS you get a plethora of hits. o\tThe most interesting observation is the clear volume-based tiers offered by Aternity that don?t appear to be reflected in Elavon?s quote.  o\tThere are 8 volume tiers (they start at 500-999 because the subscription indicates 500 is the minimum quantity you can buy).  The list price at this level is $8.33/mo o\tElavon?s volume of 57,600 (one year volumes multiplied by three) slots into the second highest tier (50,000-99,999) which has a list price of $2.55 o\tElavon?s offer is $6.15.  This is a 26% discount from the lowest tier list price of $8.33. o\tIn February of 2018, NPI provided another client with a review of a purchase that included SaaS subscriptions.  We were able to validate that several list prices provided in that quote matched the same list price in the Feb 2017 attached price list.  While this doesn?t confirm we have the latest price list it provides some support that it is still valid.   ?\tIn addition, to the programmatic reduced list price based on volume, in NPIs experience Elavon should also receive a discount off that.  30% would be a solid (not aggressive) discount target.  The caveat is if there?s some reason Riverbed doesn?t discount Aternity subscriptions similar to other SaaS subscriptions (NPIs recent experience was with SteelCentral AppInternals SaaS Core). ?\tElavon should seek a starting price of $2.55.  Software One may get a bit wily and indicate they need to use the annual volume of 19,200 which has a list price of $3.15 (tier is 10,000-29,999).  Additionally, a discount of 25-35% should be offered especially if this is a first-time purchase.  The table below shows these scenarios, the targets and targeted reductions.  These are quite significant.  While NPI admits to not having performed an Aternity-related review in the past we believe there?s enough findings to support Elavon seeking reductions or at least some rock solid explanations if the current offer is truly a good one.  ?\tNPI also recommends Elavon take a look at past discounts on any recent/prior Riverbed hardware purchases to see the historical discounts offered by Riverbed as this can support current targets. ?\tIt would be interesting to see what list price and discount are  being used to come up with the $6.15 offer. While it is possible the other two parts have list prices >$0 that aren?t being shown I?d push for clear evidence of that. ?\tRiverbed does not offer the best search tool to find partners and see their level within the ecosystem but SoftwareOne may not be the highest partner with Riverbed and this may be evidenced in their offer. http://partnerlocator.riverbed.com/ Searching in Georgia NPI didn?t see SoftwareOne show up in the list.  An even broader search didn?t find a hit either. The levels were Elite, Premier and Authorized.  Ask S1 if they?re a partner and their level.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI has seen In the recent past, Altify has used the following discount table (for what? Single product?  Bundles?): 0 > 50 = 5% 51 > 150 = 15% 150 > 300 = 25% 300 > 400 = 32.50% 400 > 1500  = 40%  JCI?s pricing picks up from this point but starts at 41%, which NPI considers to be ABOVE FMV (for clarity, pricing is high, discounting is low).  Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "Most of the guideline recommendations on slide 2 in the VzW deck are basic recommendations that should be implemented. Similar recommendations should be obtained from AT&T for optimization.   For comparisons, it was good to bring in T-Mobile, however, we see most clients using them in limited cases due to coverage issues. Alternatively, NetApp should look at MetTel for comparative quotes. They are an MVNO that can be creative in the servicing of accounts such as this which ultimately drive costs down and create efficiencies. Please ask for further details.  It?s worth noting that the majority of cost savings in the cellular suite of services come from optimization efforts and that the observations below should be used as a guideline.  Discounts ?\tFor an account of this size, we work to achieve discounts of 22%-23% from Verizon Wireless. They appear to be offering 14%. ?\tSimilarly, we work toward AT&T discounts of 25% for an account this size. (No ATT proposal was shared.)  Activations Credits ?\tFor an account of your size, work to get the following activation credits o\tAT&T = $150 o\tVzW = $125 (in proposal, so OK) ?\tDon?t buy accessories from carriers.  For accessories, Verizon offers a 50% discount.  Even so, their discounted prices will be much higher than even standard retail pricing.  Plans (VzW) ?\tBusiness Unlimited data (all device types), we recommend that you push to achieve rates approaching $40 per month. ?\tBusiness Limited could go as low as $30 per month.  Pool optimization ?\tRecommend the buffer should be managed to ~10%. ?\tOne potential issue with the proposed plan distribution is management of the pool. With the amount of plan types being proposed, pool management can be problematic. You can save time, hassle, and cost by reducing the number of plans.  Make sure that the contract terms allow unlimited movement from one pricing plan to another in a given month.   Additional observations ?\tWe agree that Travel Pass should be added to all international roaming phones, as suggested in the proposal. ?\tOn the TCO, cell H8, you indicate an AT&T MARC of $6 MM ? does this include a substantial wireline spend?  Otherwise, you will not hit it, so don?t agree to it. ?\tFor true TCO calculation and proposal analysis, we strongly recommend to perform an independent cost assessment using recent actual data usage (available from the billing portals) by a 3rd party SME. Any time a provider recommends how to pay them less, their analysis should be fully scrutinized.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Apttus and found the proposal to be in the range of FMV with scope for improvement. ?\tApttus has proposed pricing of $35.25 for the Enterprise CLM edition.  ?\tThe pricing appears to be grandfathered from Aramark?s pricing for Contract Wizard which is one of the key functionalities in Enterprise CLM.  ?\tAramark?s current pricing of $39.75 for Contract Wizard for about 800 users represents a discount of 47%. ?\tFor 1386 users, the discount tier in the 2013 contract is 53% which translates to a price of $35.25 per user per month.  Below is the snapshot of Aramark?s discount tiers in the 2013 MSA.   NPI has seen pricing for Apttus CLM range between $22 and $60. NPI has observed that there is no consistency in pricing and there is large variance in the market. Pricing is not necessarily closely correlated with the purchase volume; it varies based on many factors and depends mainly on the presence of competition (especially at the time of the initial purchase) as well as customer?s requirements and negotiation leverage. NPI recommends target pricing of $33 per user per month for CLM Enterprise. Achieving a target of $33 per user per month translates to savings of $37K annually.  However, the fact that this is largely a renewal and hence there is a lack of competition reduces Aramark?s leverage. NPI also recommends that Aramark ask about tiered pricing and the associated price breaks as well as capped/flat out year pricing.

In addition to including Contract Wizard, which is one of the key functions, but not the only key function in the Enterprise CLM offering, it includes the other components that Aramark currently licenses, plus a good amount more which Aramark may find useful.",

Targets ?\tNPI recommends targeting a ?freeze? on 2017 pricing at ~$111,872. ?\tNPI typically will NOT see a roll-back on pricing, yet will often see a ?freeze? to the prior years? renewal rate. ?\tIf Guitar Center is willing to consider a multi-year deal, a potential roll-back may be possible. ?\tA conservative $110K baseline on a multi-year deal with no annual increase for 3 years will lock in pricing and save an estimated $26,159 using an assumed 3% Y/Y increase (2018: $115,228, 2019: $118,685, 2020: $122,246) ?\tThe realized savings from reducing the proposed $115,682 spend to a multi-year $110K spend would result in a $26,613 savings in comparison to a business as usual 3% Y/Y increase (shown below).

Both JDA and Guitar Center have ?wins? by securing a multi-year deal.  JDA has stability in revenue and Guitar Center has stability in budgeting and pricing. ?\tA $106K - $110K is ?fair and reasonable? compromise for both parties. ?\tPoint out that support costs have increased 31% since the original contract. ?\tBoth JDA and Guitar Center have acted in good faith in the annual increases of the past.  Yet? The increases over the years have begun to become somewhat of a problematic issue.  A small ?reset and pause? with new commitments from each side are now in order. ?\tNPI recommends using ?logic? and pure spreadsheets to argue the need for a potential multi-year proposal.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI has seen In the recent past, Altify has used the following discount table (for what? Single product?  Bundles?): 0 > 50 = 5% 51 > 150 = 15% 150 > 300 = 25% 300 > 400 = 32.50% 400 > 1500  = 40%  JCI?s pricing picks up from this point but starts at 41%, which NPI considers to be ABOVE FMV (for clarity, pricing is high, discounting is low).  Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "Most of the guideline recommendations on slide 2 in the VzW deck are basic recommendations that should be implemented. Similar recommendations should be obtained from AT&T for optimization.   For comparisons, it was good to bring in T-Mobile, however, we see most clients using them in limited cases due to coverage issues. Alternatively, NetApp should look at MetTel for comparative quotes. They are an MVNO that can be creative in the servicing of accounts such as this which ultimately drive costs down and create efficiencies. Please ask for further details.  It?s worth noting that the majority of cost savings in the cellular suite of services come from optimization efforts and that the observations below should be used as a guideline.  Discounts ?\tFor an account of this size, we work to achieve discounts of 22%-23% from Verizon Wireless. They appear to be offering 14%. ?\tSimilarly, we work toward AT&T discounts of 25% for an account this size. (No ATT proposal was shared.)  Activations Credits ?\tFor an account of your size, work to get the following activation credits o\tAT&T = $150 o\tVzW = $125 (in proposal, so OK) ?\tDon?t buy accessories from carriers.  For accessories, Verizon offers a 50% discount.  Even so, their discounted prices will be much higher than even standard retail pricing.  Plans (VzW) ?\tBusiness Unlimited data (all device types), we recommend that you push to achieve rates approaching $40 per month. ?\tBusiness Limited could go as low as $30 per month.  Pool optimization ?\tRecommend the buffer should be managed to ~10%. ?\tOne potential issue with the proposed plan distribution is management of the pool. With the amount of plan types being proposed, pool management can be problematic. You can save time, hassle, and cost by reducing the number of plans.  Make sure that the contract terms allow unlimited movement from one pricing plan to another in a given month.   Additional observations ?\tWe agree that Travel Pass should be added to all international roaming phones, as suggested in the proposal. ?\tOn the TCO, cell H8, you indicate an AT&T MARC of $6 MM ? does this include a substantial wireline spend?  Otherwise, you will not hit it, so don?t agree to it. ?\tFor true TCO calculation and proposal analysis, we strongly recommend to perform an independent cost assessment using recent actual data usage (available from the billing portals) by a 3rd party SME. Any time a provider recommends how to pay them less, their analysis should be fully scrutinized.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Apttus and found the proposal to be in the range of FMV with scope for improvement. ?\tApttus has proposed pricing of $35.25 for the Enterprise CLM edition.  ?\tThe pricing appears to be grandfathered from Aramark?s pricing for Contract Wizard which is one of the key functionalities in Enterprise CLM.  ?\tAramark?s current pricing of $39.75 for Contract Wizard for about 800 users represents a discount of 47%. ?\tFor 1386 users, the discount tier in the 2013 contract is 53% which translates to a price of $35.25 per user per month.  Below is the snapshot of Aramark?s discount tiers in the 2013 MSA.   NPI has seen pricing for Apttus CLM range between $22 and $60. NPI has observed that there is no consistency in pricing and there is large variance in the market. Pricing is not necessarily closely correlated with the purchase volume; it varies based on many factors and depends mainly on the presence of competition (especially at the time of the initial purchase) as well as customer?s requirements and negotiation leverage. NPI recommends target pricing of $33 per user per month for CLM Enterprise. Achieving a target of $33 per user per month translates to savings of $37K annually.  However, the fact that this is largely a renewal and hence there is a lack of competition reduces Aramark?s leverage. NPI also recommends that Aramark ask about tiered pricing and the associated price breaks as well as capped/flat out year pricing. License Type\tQty\tPrice\tTerm\tTotal Annual Price\tTotal Price\tTarget Price\tTarget Annual Price\tAnnual Savings\tTarget Total Price\tTotal Savings Enterprise CLM Edition\t786\t$35.25 \t48\t$332,478 \t$1,329,912 \t$33 \t$311,256 \t$21,222 \t$1,245,024 \t$84,888  Enterprise CLM Edition\t600\t$35.25 \t47\t$253,800 \t$994,050 \t$33 \t$237,600 \t$16,200 \t$930,600 \t$63,450   Overall, the Enterprise CLM offering is a better value for Aramark (as compared to the current cost of Contract Wizard licenses).  In addition to including Contract Wizard, which is one of the key functions, but not the only key function in the Enterprise CLM offering, it includes the other components that Aramark currently licenses, plus a good amount more which Aramark may find useful.",

While we have not seen a ton of Vertiv deals, we HAVE seen a few renewals so we were able to draw some comparisons with your pricing.  To save the suspense, NPI finds the pricing to be at Fair Market Value (FMV).    Our FMV assessment is largely based on the statement in the deal profile, that Vertiv Services has ?reduced pricing to the same dollar values as in 2014.?  Typically we see Vertiv renewals that will have a 3% - 7% increase year over year.  In the Vertiv renewal deals that NPI has reviewed, we have not seen Vertiv offer pricing below the previous renewal or purchase.  Therefore, keeping pricing flat (or same dollar value if equipment has changed) is typically the best result for this type of renewal.  Based on the information that NPI has, we believe this pricing is FMV and SCH could move forward with confidence.",

Bundles?): 0 > 50 = 5% 51 > 150 = 15% 150 > 300 = 25% 300 > 400 = 32.50% 400 > 1500  = 40%  JCI?s pricing picks up from this point but starts at 41%, which NPI considers to be ABOVE FMV (for clarity, pricing is high, discounting is low).  Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the proposed rates from KPMG and determined that the pricing and rates were above Fair Market Value (FMV), based on the size of the project. with scope for improvement in the pricing. The savings opportunity is about $1.2M for the engagement and translates to 8.2% of the proposed cost.  Pricing Analysis ?\tThe blended rate for the SOW is $206/hour. Blended rates for similar projects which are based in the US with no offshore component are typically between $195/hour and $225/hour based on the number of offshore hours, mix and seniority of the resources, etc.  NPI recommends a target blended rate no greater than $200/hour. ?\tOverall, benchmarking and negotiating rates and volume discounts from the Big 4 consulting firms involve as much art as science because of their organization structure? they are partnership based firms. o Between the 4 firms, there are 10,000 + partners whose annual income is based on revenue/profits from their customers. The partners, therefore, have some degree of autonomy where pricing/billing decisions are concerned.  ?\tSome of the firms, like Deloitte, PWC and KPMG, have a standard or list price for the rates that they sometimes reveal to their customers. This sets the ceiling on the rate. Actual (negotiated) rates are discounted off of these rates. Other firms, like E&Y, don?t usually reveal a set of standard rates.  ?\tIn addition to the rates, volume discounts and tiers are also negotiable and depend on the customer?s leverage. These discounts can be applied in various ways.  1)\tA discount is applied upfront to the committed spend in the SOW. If the customer has a number of ongoing projects with the customer, 2)\t credit provided at the end of the year based on the actual spend. This can be in the form of a check (this is rare). 3)\tVolume discount is applied to the future spend based on the previous year?s spend.   Targets  NPI has provided the target fair market value rates for all the roles in the attached excel sheet.   ?\tThe categories/roles which are within FMV are highlighted in green. ?\tThe rows highlighted in yellow are those where there is scope for improvement in the rates. ?\tAchieving these target rates brings the blended rate down to $197.6 per hour and translates to savings of $567K.  ?\tNPI also recommends negotiating a volume discount of 5% based on the large spend. NPI has seen KPMG offer a discount of 5% off the negotiated cost of the SOW(s) if the customer commits to large spend volumes. Achieving an additional 5% discount translates to savings of $669K. ?\tThe PMO effort is rather high as compared to other similar projects. NPI recommends moving 30% of PM hours to other areas.",

While we have not seen a ton of Vertiv deals, we HAVE seen a few renewals so we were able to draw some comparisons with your pricing.  To save the suspense, NPI finds the pricing to be at Fair Market Value (FMV).    Our FMV assessment is largely based on the statement in the deal profile, that Vertiv Services has ?reduced pricing to the same dollar values as in 2014.?  Typically we see Vertiv renewals that will have a 3% - 7% increase year over year.  In the Vertiv renewal deals that NPI has reviewed, we have not seen Vertiv offer pricing below the previous renewal or purchase.  Therefore, keeping pricing flat (or same dollar value if equipment has changed) is typically the best result for this type of renewal.  Based on the information that NPI has, we believe this pricing is FMV and SCH could move forward with confidence.",

Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the proposed rates from KPMG and determined that the pricing and rates were above Fair Market Value (FMV), based on the size of the project. with scope for improvement in the pricing. The savings opportunity is about $1.2M for the engagement and translates to 8.2% of the proposed cost.  Pricing Analysis ?\tThe blended rate for the SOW is $206/hour. Blended rates for similar projects which are based in the US with no offshore component are typically between $195/hour and $225/hour based on the number of offshore hours, mix and seniority of the resources, etc.  NPI recommends a target blended rate no greater than $200/hour. ?\tOverall, benchmarking and negotiating rates and volume discounts from the Big 4 consulting firms involve as much art as science because of their organization structure? they are partnership based firms. o Between the 4 firms, there are 10,000 + partners whose annual income is based on revenue/profits from their customers. The partners, therefore, have some degree of autonomy where pricing/billing decisions are concerned.  ?\tSome of the firms, like Deloitte, PWC and KPMG, have a standard or list price for the rates that they sometimes reveal to their customers. This sets the ceiling on the rate. Actual (negotiated) rates are discounted off of these rates. Other firms, like E&Y, don?t usually reveal a set of standard rates.  ?\tIn addition to the rates, volume discounts and tiers are also negotiable and depend on the customer?s leverage. These discounts can be applied in various ways.  1)\tA discount is applied upfront to the committed spend in the SOW. If the customer has a number of ongoing projects with the customer, 2)\t credit provided at the end of the year based on the actual spend. This can be in the form of a check (this is rare). 3)\tVolume discount is applied to the future spend based on the previous year?s spend.   Targets  NPI has provided the target fair market value rates for all the roles in the attached excel sheet.   ?\tThe categories/roles which are within FMV are highlighted in green. ?\tThe rows highlighted in yellow are those where there is scope for improvement in the rates. ?\tAchieving these target rates brings the blended rate down to $197.6 per hour and translates to savings of $567K.  ?\tNPI also recommends negotiating a volume discount of 5% based on the large spend. NPI has seen KPMG offer a discount of 5% off the negotiated cost of the SOW(s) if the customer commits to large spend volumes. Achieving an additional 5% discount translates to savings of $669K. ?\tThe PMO effort is rather high as compared to other similar projects. NPI recommends moving 30% of PM hours to other areas.",

While we have not seen a ton of Vertiv deals, we HAVE seen a few renewals so we were able to draw some comparisons with your pricing.  To save the suspense, NPI finds the pricing to be at Fair Market Value (FMV).    Our FMV assessment is largely based on the statement in the deal profile, that Vertiv Services has ?reduced pricing to the same dollar values as in 2014.?  Typically we see Vertiv renewals that will have a 3% - 7% increase year over year.  In the Vertiv renewal deals that NPI has reviewed, we have not seen Vertiv offer pricing below the previous renewal or purchase.  Therefore, keeping pricing flat (or same dollar value if equipment has changed) is typically the best result for this type of renewal.  Based on the information that NPI has, we believe this pricing is FMV and SCH could move forward with confidence.",

Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

There is also very little competition ? primary competitors are UX consultants who customize SAP? often through GuiXT.      However, with the shift to SAP Cloud, NPI believes this product may be nearing end of life.   Synactive Inc. has not been very active from a marketing perspective.  Very little  ?current? news is available During 2016, their marketing appeared to go dark ? per their website, no press releases were published During this year 2017, one press release which highlighted a customer implementation The Liquid UI facebook page has not been updated in over a year; last update was June 2, 2016   Price Analysis In the few deals that we have seen, 18% for support seems to be the standard rate for GuiXT. We have seen the Developer Suite priced as low as $10,200,  REI?s $10,943 price is within Fair Market Value (FMV). We have seen Desktop Suite priced as low as $175 per license, REI?s $150.68 for 1600 licenses is slightly below what we have seen.   So there are lower prices that REI could have paid for licenses and hence, lower support costs, but even with the lowest license pricing that NPI has seen, the total cost of this renewal would reduce by only $1,100.   Overall, this renewal is largely within FMV with room for very small improvement.  Considering that these renewals have happened for years with little or no increase, it is unlikely that Synactive would come down on this pricing.",

        "current_narrative": "Original feedback via email... followed up with FMV report.  Hey Jack,    I have finally been able to go through the purchase docs you provided and reconcile as much as I could with the maintenance contract you are currently under.  I am sure it is no surprise that your pricing across all of your add-on purchases has been all-over-the-place: ? In the six purchases you sent over (ranging from 2008 ? 2013), discounting on the License product (71000383) ranges between 35% (2011) down to 10% (2012).  When taken alone, where each transaction is below $100K, 35% discounting would be at the low end of Fair Market Value (FMV) ? for clarity, pricing is a little high, discounting is a little below what we would expect. ? The support for the licenses in these six purchases ? as a percentage of the net license cost ? range from 17% of the net license (2012) to 25% of the net license cost (2011).  Once again, taken as stand-alone <$100K purchases, 20% of net license cost is FMV.  In the six deals you sent over, the average discount on the licenses is ~26% and support is an average 22% of the net license cost.  If we apply these numbers to your annual $375,978 maintenance renewal, this would mean that you have purchased ~$1.7M in Software ($2.3M list price at 26% discounting) from McKesson over the years.  This brings NPI to two thoughts: ? If you were spending $1.7M with McKesson in a single purchase, NPI would recommend targeting discounts on licenses between 65% - 75% and support costs should be between 15% - 20% of the net license cost. ? While we would not expect you hit 65% - 75% discounting on these smaller purchases over time, NPI does not believe that Evergreen Health should be penalized for growing the solution organically the way that you have.  You are paying a very high premium for this amount of support.  Caveat: The above analysis is based off of the small sample of deals that you sent over.  It is possible that Evergreen received better discounting and better support percentages on some of the other deals that NPI has not seen ? it is also possible that you received worse discounts and less favorable discount percentages.  The challenge comes with the 2-year agreement that you are currently in.  You _are_ pretty much locked in to that and McKesson won?t be anxious to renegotiate this mid-term, especially since you will want to significantly reduce it (NPI believes the target cost for this maintenance should be ~$162K).  In order to get McKesson to rework this agreement midway through, you will probably have to agree to a longer term deal, or make a sizable new purchase with them.",

We signed a two year agreement last year that froze maintenance increases through 2018.  These contracts generally renew in January.  We have been highly dissatisfied with their support, the software stability, and feature functionality delivered.  Last year, we sent them a RFI informing them we would be shopping for a potential replacement to their software.  The timing of that replacement was moved to 2018.  I wanted to check to see if this would be a candidate for NPI services, or whether the attached amendment puts Evergreen is a difficult negotiating position.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks!",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the proposed rates from KPMG and determined that the pricing and rates were above Fair Market Value (FMV), based on the size of the project. with scope for improvement in the pricing. The savings opportunity is about $1.2M for the engagement and translates to 8.2% of the proposed cost.  Pricing Analysis ?\tThe blended rate for the SOW is $206/hour. Blended rates for similar projects which are based in the US with no offshore component are typically between $195/hour and $225/hour based on the number of offshore hours, mix and seniority of the resources, etc.  NPI recommends a target blended rate no greater than $200/hour. ?\tOverall, benchmarking and negotiating rates and volume discounts from the Big 4 consulting firms involve as much art as science because of their organization structure? they are partnership based firms. o Between the 4 firms, there are 10,000 + partners whose annual income is based on revenue/profits from their customers. The partners, therefore, have some degree of autonomy where pricing/billing decisions are concerned.  ?\tSome of the firms, like Deloitte, PWC and KPMG, have a standard or list price for the rates that they sometimes reveal to their customers. This sets the ceiling on the rate. Actual (negotiated) rates are discounted off of these rates. Other firms, like E&Y, don?t usually reveal a set of standard rates.  ?\tIn addition to the rates, volume discounts and tiers are also negotiable and depend on the customer?s leverage. These discounts can be applied in various ways.  1)\tA discount is applied upfront to the committed spend in the SOW. If the customer has a number of ongoing projects with the customer, 2)\t credit provided at the end of the year based on the actual spend. This can be in the form of a check (this is rare). 3)\tVolume discount is applied to the future spend based on the previous year?s spend.   Targets  NPI has provided the target fair market value rates for all the roles in the attached excel sheet.   ?\tThe categories/roles which are within FMV are highlighted in green. ?\tThe rows highlighted in yellow are those where there is scope for improvement in the rates. ?\tAchieving these target rates brings the blended rate down to $197.6 per hour and translates to savings of $567K.  ?\tNPI also recommends negotiating a volume discount of 5% based on the large spend. NPI has seen KPMG offer a discount of 5% off the negotiated cost of the SOW(s) if the customer commits to large spend volumes. Achieving an additional 5% discount translates to savings of $669K. ?\tThe PMO effort is rather high as compared to other similar projects. NPI recommends moving 30% of PM hours to other areas.",

A 42% discount is the standard Gold Partner discount which is basically the minimum discount anyone receives, so you are not much more than that.  I do not know your historical discounts with Cisco which could be leverage if you have seen higher than this.  We see discounting on products like these ranging between 47-60%.  The higher discounts are for much larger deals ($1M+) so 50% is not unreasonable at all, I would even aim a bit higher and see what they will do.    The key to this is to discuss it with your Cisco rep if you can.  Presidio only makes 3-4% of the list price, so my assumption is that Presidio got a 48-49% discount and passed the 45% to you.  The Cisco rep needs to extend more discounting to pass through Presidio for you.",

        "current_narrative": "Original feedback via email... followed up with FMV report.  Hey Jack,    I have finally been able to go through the purchase docs you provided and reconcile as much as I could with the maintenance contract you are currently under.  I am sure it is no surprise that your pricing across all of your add-on purchases has been all-over-the-place: ? In the six purchases you sent over (ranging from 2008 ? 2013), discounting on the License product (71000383) ranges between 35% (2011) down to 10% (2012).  When taken alone, where each transaction is below $100K, 35% discounting would be at the low end of Fair Market Value (FMV) ? for clarity, pricing is a little high, discounting is a little below what we would expect. ? The support for the licenses in these six purchases ? as a percentage of the net license cost ? range from 17% of the net license (2012) to 25% of the net license cost (2011).  Once again, taken as stand-alone <$100K purchases, 20% of net license cost is FMV.  In the six deals you sent over, the average discount on the licenses is ~26% and support is an average 22% of the net license cost.  If we apply these numbers to your annual $375,978 maintenance renewal, this would mean that you have purchased ~$1.7M in Software ($2.3M list price at 26% discounting) from McKesson over the years.  This brings NPI to two thoughts: ? If you were spending $1.7M with McKesson in a single purchase, NPI would recommend targeting discounts on licenses between 65% - 75% and support costs should be between 15% - 20% of the net license cost. ? While we would not expect you hit 65% - 75% discounting on these smaller purchases over time, NPI does not believe that Evergreen Health should be penalized for growing the solution organically the way that you have.  You are paying a very high premium for this amount of support.  Caveat: The above analysis is based off of the small sample of deals that you sent over.  It is possible that Evergreen received better discounting and better support percentages on some of the other deals that NPI has not seen ? it is also possible that you received worse discounts and less favorable discount percentages.  The challenge comes with the 2-year agreement that you are currently in.  You _are_ pretty much locked in to that and McKesson won?t be anxious to renegotiate this mid-term, especially since you will want to significantly reduce it (NPI believes the target cost for this maintenance should be ~$162K).  In order to get McKesson to rework this agreement midway through, you will probably have to agree to a longer term deal, or make a sizable new purchase with them.",

        "description": "All,  We have several contracts with McKesson (now Change Healthcare) for software related to their homecare application. We signed a two year agreement last year that froze maintenance increases through 2018.  These contracts generally renew in January.  We have been highly dissatisfied with their support, the software stability, and feature functionality delivered.  Last year, we sent them a RFI informing them we would be shopping for a potential replacement to their software.  The timing of that replacement was moved to 2018.  I wanted to check to see if this would be a candidate for NPI services, or whether the attached amendment puts Evergreen is a difficult negotiating position.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks!",

The expanding volumes also added leverage to lower pricing. ?\tThe overall market range for Analytics (primary) varies between $25 and $1,100 based on volume and term.  ?\tA three-year term with no early termination is now the standard from Adobe.  It wasn?t always this way.  In the past AEs were only paid on first year subscription value and so they were fine doing one-year deals but now they are comped on the whole term so of course three years has become the de facto norm. REI has a 2-year option, but if REI is willing to sign up for a 3-year term, they add to the negotiation leverage to get an additional 5% -10% off of current pricing. ?\tIn the past, Adobe would charge more for overages but they?ve moved away from this and it is now typically flat unless the volume is increasing y-o-y in which case they will reduce the pricing (which is the case with REI). ?\tCost of Adobe analytics secondary calls is invariably 50% of Analytics Primary rates and this is FMV.  Additional Concessions  ?\tWe?ve seen Adobe provide these additional concessions for Analytics ?\tNet 45 days payment instead of the standard net 30 ?\tHaving a three-year bucket of server calls that allows you to essentially rollover your calls vs. use each year.  This is a rare concession.  Generally, clients grow and this presents another sale for Adobe and clients leave calls on the table from earlier parts of their contract.  This would be a great risk mitigator for REI but is rarely approved.    Adobe Target Premium  ?\tThe overall market range for Adobe Target Premium varies between $35 and $1,100 based on volume and term.  ?\tFor a volume of around 1500, $268 - $256 is within FMV.",

In summary, NPI believes that there is potential for savings averaging about 4% for the roles in the rate card.  Consulting Rates in the Enterprise Data Management solutions space (including Data Management and Data governance etc.) command a premium. Niche companies such as Utopia, WCI, SAS, T/DG and several others provide consulting services specific to this area. Larger Consulting companies like the Big 4 as well as Accenture also provide these services, but their blended rate is 5% ? 20% higher based on the project. Global IT consultants such as TCS, Infosys etc. typically bill a much lower hourly rate for their consultants (sub $150 per hour for onshore rates).",

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  You mentioned that you needed this last week, but with the other deals that NPI was reviewing for Intuit, we were only able to get to this review this week.  I hope this information is still useful for you.  NPI reviewed Intuit?s Elastic purchase last year and we found the pricing to be ABOVE Fair market Value (FMV).  The pricing was initially offered with a 45% discounting and ultimately wound up at 61% discounting, or $2,886/node.  However, the discounting is misleading because the list price changed from $5,500 in the initial quotes to $7,400 in the final pricing.  Now in this year?s proposal, the list price is $4,400.  From what NPI can tell, all of this pricing has been for the same Gold level Subscription product.  Intuit may want to inquire as to why the list price has had such variation between these proposals.  In last year?s feedback, NPI recommended targeting $2,200 per node on a 3-year commitment and that recommendation holds true for the current purchase.  A 1-year renewal should see per node pricing closer to $2,500/node.  This puts NPI?s recommended targets at $100K for a 40-node, 1-year renewal, and $220K/year for a 100-node, 3-year renewal.  The current offer has a 3-year commitment at $2,156/node and NPI would consider that to be FMV.",

        "current_narrative": "Original feedback via email... followed up with FMV report.  Hey Jack,    I have finally been able to go through the purchase docs you provided and reconcile as much as I could with the maintenance contract you are currently under.  I am sure it is no surprise that your pricing across all of your add-on purchases has been all-over-the-place: ? In the six purchases you sent over (ranging from 2008 ? 2013), discounting on the License product (71000383) ranges between 35% (2011) down to 10% (2012).  When taken alone, where each transaction is below $100K, 35% discounting would be at the low end of Fair Market Value (FMV) ? for clarity, pricing is a little high, discounting is a little below what we would expect. ? The support for the licenses in these six purchases ? as a percentage of the net license cost ? range from 17% of the net license (2012) to 25% of the net license cost (2011).  Once again, taken as stand-alone <$100K purchases, 20% of net license cost is FMV.  In the six deals you sent over, the average discount on the licenses is ~26% and support is an average 22% of the net license cost.  If we apply these numbers to your annual $375,978 maintenance renewal, this would mean that you have purchased ~$1.7M in Software ($2.3M list price at 26% discounting) from McKesson over the years.  This brings NPI to two thoughts: ? If you were spending $1.7M with McKesson in a single purchase, NPI would recommend targeting discounts on licenses between 65% - 75% and support costs should be between 15% - 20% of the net license cost. ? While we would not expect you hit 65% - 75% discounting on these smaller purchases over time, NPI does not believe that Evergreen Health should be penalized for growing the solution organically the way that you have.  You are paying a very high premium for this amount of support.  Caveat: The above analysis is based off of the small sample of deals that you sent over.  It is possible that Evergreen received better discounting and better support percentages on some of the other deals that NPI has not seen ? it is also possible that you received worse discounts and less favorable discount percentages.  The challenge comes with the 2-year agreement that you are currently in.  You _are_ pretty much locked in to that and McKesson won?t be anxious to renegotiate this mid-term, especially since you will want to significantly reduce it (NPI believes the target cost for this maintenance should be ~$162K).  In order to get McKesson to rework this agreement midway through, you will probably have to agree to a longer term deal, or make a sizable new purchase with them.",

        "description": "All,  We have several contracts with McKesson (now Change Healthcare) for software related to their homecare application. We signed a two year agreement last year that froze maintenance increases through 2018.  These contracts generally renew in January.  We have been highly dissatisfied with their support, the software stability, and feature functionality delivered.  Last year, we sent them a RFI informing them we would be shopping for a potential replacement to their software.  The timing of that replacement was moved to 2018.  I wanted to check to see if this would be a candidate for NPI services, or whether the attached amendment puts Evergreen is a difficult negotiating position.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks!",

Consulting Rates in the Enterprise Data Management solutions space (including Data Management and Data governance etc.) command a premium. Niche companies such as Utopia, WCI, SAS, T/DG and several others provide consulting services specific to this area. Larger Consulting companies like the Big 4 as well as Accenture also provide these services, but their blended rate is 5% ? 20% higher based on the project. Global IT consultants such as TCS, Infosys etc. typically bill a much lower hourly rate for their consultants (sub $150 per hour for onshore rates).",

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  You mentioned that you needed this last week, but with the other deals that NPI was reviewing for Intuit, we were only able to get to this review this week.  I hope this information is still useful for you.  NPI reviewed Intuit?s Elastic purchase last year and we found the pricing to be ABOVE Fair market Value (FMV).  The pricing was initially offered with a 45% discounting and ultimately wound up at 61% discounting, or $2,886/node.  However, the discounting is misleading because the list price changed from $5,500 in the initial quotes to $7,400 in the final pricing.  Now in this year?s proposal, the list price is $4,400.  From what NPI can tell, all of this pricing has been for the same Gold level Subscription product.  Intuit may want to inquire as to why the list price has had such variation between these proposals.  In last year?s feedback, NPI recommended targeting $2,200 per node on a 3-year commitment and that recommendation holds true for the current purchase.  A 1-year renewal should see per node pricing closer to $2,500/node.  This puts NPI?s recommended targets at $100K for a 40-node, 1-year renewal, and $220K/year for a 100-node, 3-year renewal.  The current offer has a 3-year commitment at $2,156/node and NPI would consider that to be FMV.",

Review final pricing to ensure that support lands at 20% of the final hardware and software costs.    Negotiation Leverage and Strategy ?\tIn contrast to the prior negotiation tactics with Ivoxy, NPI recommends that rather than focusing on dollar amounts, SCH should work with Ivoxy and push them for the same discounts as previously received.  Because SCH now has a target discount to strive for, it sets a somewhat innocent target that needs to be met.   ?\tNPI would expect a pushback based on the prior deal was ~ 1 million greater in list pricing.  Reality is that after discounts are applied, the differences are within a few hundred thousand and still warrant discount levels greater than the current 64% on hardware and software. ?\t?New logo? opportunities help drive discounting a little deeper.  This deeper discounting may have occurred in the prior deal.  The position that SCH should maintain is that ?we can still easily choose to play a dual vendor strategy with our storage solutions if we can?t find the right solution at the right price?. ?\tSupport is currently quoted at 23% of the combined hardware and software costs.  NPI recommends that SCH target a 20% of net price of hardware and software. ?\tNetApp Q3 end is 10/31 and a quarter-end deal will typically allow for the best negotiation power with a promise to close this deal in Q3.",

Over the past year, we have seen a number of Hearsay purchases and renewals and we have onboarded an Advisor (recent, former Hearsay salesperson) who is able to give us additional help in reviewing these transactions.    NPI?s FMV assessment is attached.  High-level: current agreement pricing is solid ? if COUNTRY is able to make a multi-year commitment then there may be savings available on this proposal.",

        "current_narrative": "Hi Kathleen,  Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  NPI reviewed Intuit?s LivePerson agreement last year ? as it turns out, this was a post-mortem and the deal had already been completed.  I?ve attached the review we did last year, and our feedback is similar this year.  From what NPI has seen on somewhat smaller LivePerson deals, this pricing is highly-negotiable.  We believe that the proposed $.80 per engagement for the 1.5M tier is at the very upper edge of Fair Market Value (FMV).   Last year, NPI recommended targeting $.60 per engagement for a deal of that size (2M+ engagements).  Considering the reduction in scope, as well as a partial, 9-month term, our recommended target for a this transaction would be between $.75 - $.81.  So we believe that the current pricing on the 1.5M tier is at the very upper edge of FMV with room for improvement.  Customer Success, however, is well over-priced on a deal of this size.  We typically see CSO offered at 25% - 30% of the platform cost.  LivePerson has left CSO at $37,600/month which totals 36% of the platform cost.  Intuit will want to push hard to get the CSO costs down closer to $300K/yr (25% of platform cost).",

At that time, we had not seen many Hearsay proposals and we did not have a SME in our Advisor Network who could help us with a review.  Over the past year, we have seen a number of Hearsay purchases and renewals and we have onboarded an Advisor (recent, former Hearsay salesperson) who is able to give us additional help in reviewing these transactions.    NPI?s FMV assessment is attached.  High-level: current agreement pricing is solid ? if COUNTRY is able to make a multi-year commitment then there may be savings available on this proposal.",

NPI reviewed Intuit?s LivePerson agreement last year ? as it turns out, this was a post-mortem and the deal had already been completed.  I?ve attached the review we did last year, and our feedback is similar this year.  From what NPI has seen on somewhat smaller LivePerson deals, this pricing is highly-negotiable.  We believe that the proposed $.80 per engagement for the 1.5M tier is at the very upper edge of Fair Market Value (FMV).   Last year, NPI recommended targeting $.60 per engagement for a deal of that size (2M+ engagements).  Considering the reduction in scope, as well as a partial, 9-month term, our recommended target for a this transaction would be between $.75 - $.81.  So we believe that the current pricing on the 1.5M tier is at the very upper edge of FMV with room for improvement.  Customer Success, however, is well over-priced on a deal of this size.  We typically see CSO offered at 25% - 30% of the platform cost.  LivePerson has left CSO at $37,600/month which totals 36% of the platform cost.  Intuit will want to push hard to get the CSO costs down closer to $300K/yr (25% of platform cost).",

We signed the current agreement 4 years ago with a much smaller strategic importance to Pacific Life.  Over the next 3-5 years AWS will become one of the most critical vendors to our operational success and we want to be sure we have a solid contract in place.",

In fact I have not even told Hortonworks (HW) that they have won the bid on our project.  The pricing is from the Account Rep at HW.    The F (Chirs) column is current quoting .  The G (Sam) column was a special pricing last year only because we bundled it with a Renewal which had an overall discount of 27% actually.  Chris states he cannot give the 50% because that was a bundle with a renewal and the best his CFO will allow is 35% off list.   Technically Hortonworks only allows upfront payments and 32 month terms to get the 35% discount.  2 year is 25% and 1 year is 15%.   We are aware of HW financial risk and have been watching them so we are not keen on paying up front and are in process of amending their contract with this purchase to pay annually/quarterly/monthly but not all 32 months up front.   They may not grant the 35% if I tell them that, but I am waiting to drop all of my demands on them at once- still waiting for the contract amendment to be complete by our legal.  I am also leveraging another vendor called Softpath, but have not talked to them yet.     Do you have any other customers who use Hortonworks?  Thanks, Elena",

        "current_narrative": "Hi Roy, Smita is OOO until Friday so I went through her recent effort to try and provide some feedback on this add-on subscription.  I can definitely confirm the SKU consolidation noted by Oracle. They have a document called their Fusion Cloud Service Descriptions document and the latest one clearly indicates the merging that you describe.  I?m assuming this is in addition to the review that Smita just provided. Let?s encapsulate that one: ?\t$5.2M in list costs over five years or $1,036,000 a year ?\t$2.5M in net costs over five years or $500K a year ?\t52% discount on each line item ?\t61% targeted discount suggested by NPI ?\tB67272 is the SKU that absorbed B67270.  These had respective list prices of $40 and $5 per month in 2015 and now that they?re combined the new list is still $40 for 67272.  Equifax got a 38% discount in 2015 and the current offer that we reviewed was at 52%.  The volume went up considerably from 300 to 1950 and the term lengthened from 3 years to 5 years. ?\tThere were two other products that comprised only 10% of the quote and had the same 52% discount and 61% target.  The renewal summarizes as follows: ?\t$1.2M in list costs over five years or $240K a year ?\t$674,655 in net costs over five years or ~$135K a year ?\tB75289 used to list for $400.  It now includes B69716 which listed for $50.  Together they increased the new B75289 to a sizable $650/mo which is 44% more than the combined $400+$50.  NPI hasn?t done a comparison of the capabilities of the software before and after but we certainly hope Oracle can articulate the reason behind the sizable increase. o\tOffered at $346.77 per month that?s a 46.7% discount.  This is less than the 52% offer on the other part of this renewal NPI recently reviewed.  In addition, compared to the combined total of the prior list prices of $450 it is a paltry 23% discount.  Of course, Oracle can highlight you only got a 25% discount in 2015 and now you?re at 46.7% (of course they raised prices 44%!) o\tNPI can see that the final outcomes in 2015 of $299 and $37 total $336 for these two SKUs and the $347.77 is 3% more than this.  Numbers can really get your head spinning of course.  A 3% increase seems reasonable in the Oracle ecosphere. o\tMore important to NPI the fact that Equifax is signing up for 5 years not 3 and expanding your extended list subscription costs from $1,071,000 over three years to about $6.5M over five years.  That?s a HUGE increase. This is enough of a change to get this repriced vs. accepting a 3% increase.  (Caveat: NPI is assuming the review from several weeks ago is in addition to this subscription) ?\tB69730 used to list for $150 and B69731 listed for $50.  You?d expect the newly-reconstituted B69730 to have increased in price but it is still at $150. o\tThe $103 offer is a 31% discount.  The quote 2 weeks ago had each line item the same. That is often the case with Oracle Fusion quotes but this quote has one at 46.7% and one at 31%. o\tNPI can see that total net price was $100 in 2015 and $103 is a 3% increase.  These were discounted 50% in 2015.  This one dropped from 50% to 31%. A bit unusual for Oracle. o\tThe blended discount is 44%.   Assuming, this is in addition to the prior review NPI sees no reason to not repeat our 61% discount target across the board.  The term and list spend has increases a lot and Equifax is a huge Oracle client.  You deserve top tier pricing. This does represent a sizable $200K cost reduction which is tough to get from Oracle on a renewal that is mid quarter and can only be attained by leveraging the other renewal?s growth. Standalone a blended 44% could be considered FMV with a blended target of 50%.",

This is a below the minimum dollar threshold for deals that NPI will typically review for Intuit (threshold is $100K).  However, I have a bit of Preemptive data and I did a quick analysis of this quote.  First, any type of unlimited license is very difficult to benchmark without expected usage rates.  Based on the comparative data that NPI has, $9K for an unlimited license appears to be within Fair Market Value (FMV); however, the true FMV for this will depend on how many users actually use the system.  The 12 Dotfuscator build licenses are pro-rated for 12-month (and longer) terms.  By NPI?s math, each build license has an annual cost of around $1.2K, and they are prorated out for the extended term.  Overall, this is within FMV.  NPI has seen Dotfuscator licenses offered slightly lower on larger deals, but we would consider this to be FMV.  Overall, for a deal of this size, NPI considers this pricing to be within FMV and Intuit can move forward.",

As we discussed, I was hoping you had someone on your team that could review these agreements and suggest any best practices for terms that are favorable to, and protect Pacific Life during our likely very long relationship.  We signed the current agreement 4 years ago with a much smaller strategic importance to Pacific Life.  Over the next 3-5 years AWS will become one of the most critical vendors to our operational success and we want to be sure we have a solid contract in place.",

While license costs for Infor and Kronos are comparable, the implementation from Infor's partner Axsium is more than 5x WFCs for the Kronos solution.  Other scoped implementations have fallen in a middle range of the extremes.  5/16 Received the final Subscription.  We will bill for that and wait on services.  They are looking at other PS firms to validate Axsium scope before committing.   Gregg asked KT about discounts and this is the reply that was worth capturing: We weren?t able to determine the discount, but we also haven?t received final docs or any formal Infor quote yet.  While it?s not a discount, we did see them drop pricing from $307k per year to an anticipated $265k (still waiting on the exact final number for the subscription portion, but this was communicated verbally to Zumiez as the projected price).  That?d imply an additional discount of 14%.    The implementer also discounted labor rates from $175 -> $155, an 11% drop.  Not exactly discounts but that?s what we have so far.",
        "customer_comments": "The wide gap in implementation costs could mean Infor knows they are preferred and are trying to inflate costs.  Despite this, Zumiez is happy with most of Axsium's work so far.  Protecting information around Infor as the definite choice will be crucial in preserving leverage.",

The information below did not lend itself to a more formal FMV report, but if you need a formal document, I can create one for you.  It appears this maintenance renewal is priced within Fair Market Value (FMV).    Quest software maintenance is typically priced at ~15% of the software license cost.  Based on NPI?s knowledge of the VRanger product, it appears that this renewal is priced at ~17%, so this is in the range of FMV.    If COUNTRY wanted to push a bit, you could request that this pricing get below $12.5K in order to meet operating budget numbers.  Based on the size of this deal, there may not be much leverage.  COUNTRY could point to potential growth in the future and express that the current pricing may stifle growth of the VRanger solution.",

        "current_narrative": "Hi Roy, Smita is OOO until Friday so I went through her recent effort to try and provide some feedback on this add-on subscription.  I can definitely confirm the SKU consolidation noted by Oracle. They have a document called their Fusion Cloud Service Descriptions document and the latest one clearly indicates the merging that you describe.  I?m assuming this is in addition to the review that Smita just provided. Let?s encapsulate that one: ?\t$5.2M in list costs over five years or $1,036,000 a year ?\t$2.5M in net costs over five years or $500K a year ?\t52% discount on each line item ?\t61% targeted discount suggested by NPI ?\tB67272 is the SKU that absorbed B67270.  These had respective list prices of $40 and $5 per month in 2015 and now that they?re combined the new list is still $40 for 67272.  Equifax got a 38% discount in 2015 and the current offer that we reviewed was at 52%.  The volume went up considerably from 300 to 1950 and the term lengthened from 3 years to 5 years. ?\tThere were two other products that comprised only 10% of the quote and had the same 52% discount and 61% target.  The renewal summarizes as follows: ?\t$1.2M in list costs over five years or $240K a year ?\t$674,655 in net costs over five years or ~$135K a year ?\tB75289 used to list for $400.  It now includes B69716 which listed for $50.  Together they increased the new B75289 to a sizable $650/mo which is 44% more than the combined $400+$50.  NPI hasn?t done a comparison of the capabilities of the software before and after but we certainly hope Oracle can articulate the reason behind the sizable increase. o\tOffered at $346.77 per month that?s a 46.7% discount.  This is less than the 52% offer on the other part of this renewal NPI recently reviewed.  In addition, compared to the combined total of the prior list prices of $450 it is a paltry 23% discount.  Of course, Oracle can highlight you only got a 25% discount in 2015 and now you?re at 46.7% (of course they raised prices 44%!) o\tNPI can see that the final outcomes in 2015 of $299 and $37 total $336 for these two SKUs and the $347.77 is 3% more than this.  Numbers can really get your head spinning of course.  A 3% increase seems reasonable in the Oracle ecosphere. o\tMore important to NPI the fact that Equifax is signing up for 5 years not 3 and expanding your extended list subscription costs from $1,071,000 over three years to about $6.5M over five years.  That?s a HUGE increase. This is enough of a change to get this repriced vs. accepting a 3% increase.  (Caveat: NPI is assuming the review from several weeks ago is in addition to this subscription) ?\tB69730 used to list for $150 and B69731 listed for $50.  You?d expect the newly-reconstituted B69730 to have increased in price but it is still at $150. o\tThe $103 offer is a 31% discount.  The quote 2 weeks ago had each line item the same. That is often the case with Oracle Fusion quotes but this quote has one at 46.7% and one at 31%. o\tNPI can see that total net price was $100 in 2015 and $103 is a 3% increase.  These were discounted 50% in 2015.  This one dropped from 50% to 31%. A bit unusual for Oracle. o\tThe blended discount is 44%.   Assuming, this is in addition to the prior review NPI sees no reason to not repeat our 61% discount target across the board.  The term and list spend has increases a lot and Equifax is a huge Oracle client.  You deserve top tier pricing. This does represent a sizable $200K cost reduction which is tough to get from Oracle on a renewal that is mid quarter and can only be attained by leveraging the other renewal?s growth. Standalone a blended 44% could be considered FMV with a blended target of 50%.",

Hosted Named user B69730 - Oracle Fusion Product Hub Cloud Service - Hosted 1,000 Records  This is part of the 2015 purchase you provided feedback a couple of weeks ago. Oracle has confirmed that the two original Business intelligence part numbers included in the 2015 ordering document along with all its functionality for each have been consolidated into their respective base product. So original part number B69731 is now included as part of B69730, and B69716 is now part of B75289.  Below is Oracle?s current offer. They added together the pricing from the original deal, and then added a 3% increase.",
