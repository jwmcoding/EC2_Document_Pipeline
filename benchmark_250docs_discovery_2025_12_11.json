        "current_narrative": "Chris, We reviewed Intuit?s renewal pricing from Jive. On the initial purchase in 2015, there were a couple of iterations and the final term was one year for $400K.  It allowed for a first renewal at $420K for 10,000 users and then had language indicating another four renewals wouldn?t increase by more than 5% each year.   NPIs top end target was $40/user/year and Intuit improved upon its initial $48/offer when the deal was finalized. NPI didn?t review last year?s renewal.  Per the terms of the contract this second renewal shouldn?t exceed 105% of $420K or $441K.  The renewal is for essentially the identical subscription and set of features.  It now includes Encryption at Rest and Cloud Private Preview which were separately added in mid-2016.  The base cost is $420K a year or $42 per person (10,000 users) plus $25K for Encryption and $15K for Cloud Private Preview.  Jive is likely not exercising its right to increase costs 5% on the core subscription to offset the added costs of Encryption and Private Preview now that the two contracts have merged.  The annualized cost of Encryption was $50K and $15K for Private Preview when NPI did our initial review in 2016.  NPI never learned the outcome of this add-on purchase but it appears a further reduction of Encryption was received since the renewal is at $25K.  NPI is assuming Encryption landed at $25K and Private Preview at $15K and they are also renewing at a flat cost.  The offer of $460K appears to be flat compared to the prior two years.  This is great since we know Jive has the right to at least increase the core subscription by 5%.  NPI wouldn?t expect a reduction in costs on a flat renewal.  While this isn?t the inaugural term for Private Review on another recent renewal for a client with 7000 users, Cloud Private Preview was included at no charge.  However, in this case this was an add-on to the renewal.  Intuit has already contracted for Private Preview so it can be hard to negotiate those costs out.  The site link below provides some good detail about Private Preview.  Intuit could consider making the case that Private Preview strongly helps Jive thrive and expand at Intuit and push back on the $15K spend.  https://community.jivesoftware.com/docs/DOC-180119",

        "customer_comments": "So this feedback is less about a benchmark and more about sharing the findings from some research we performed.  While we?ve done a ton of Riverbed hardware and support reviews and a few Riverbed SaaS reviews, none of these involved Aternity.  They?re an Israeli company that Riverbed bought toward the end of 2016.  http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-riverbed-acquires-israeli-saas-co-aternity-for-70m-1001142685  https://www.riverbed.com/press-releases/riverbed-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-leading-end-user-experience-monitoring-provider-aternity.html  The punchline is we believe there?s room for substantial savings.  We found it odd that the one year and three year offers were added together by SoftwareOne and that the multi-year offer didn?t reflect any improved discount.   ?\tElavon?s quotes didn?t include list pricing or provide any indication of the discount being offered ?\tIn NPIs experience, Riverbed has offered the same discount levels for hardware, software and SaaS subscriptions ?\tNPI believes we determined the list price for the primary Part Number ? ATNY-SAAS.  We also believe the other two Parts are zero dollar items.  This is an oddly-constructed set of parts as all three line items seem to just restate the same words just in a different order for the most part.  ?\tPart of our efforts were to validate that the two zero dollar items are typically no cost items.  While we found listings on CDW for the ATNY-SAAS product we got no hits at all when searching sites for pricing on the other two products. ?\tAdditionally, NPI has the attached price list from early 2017.  If you search ATNY-SAAS-PTO you will get only one hit for a zero dollar evaluation license.  If you search LIC-ATNY-SAAS you will get no hits.  If you search ATNY-SAAS you get a plethora of hits. o\tThe most interesting observation is the clear volume-based tiers offered by Aternity that don?t appear to be reflected in Elavon?s quote.  o\tThere are 8 volume tiers (they start at 500-999 because the subscription indicates 500 is the minimum quantity you can buy).  The list price at this level is $8.33/mo o\tElavon?s volume of 57,600 (one year volumes multiplied by three) slots into the second highest tier (50,000-99,999) which has a list price of $2.55 o\tElavon?s offer is $6.15.  This is a 26% discount from the lowest tier list price of $8.33. o\tIn February of 2018, NPI provided another client with a review of a purchase that included SaaS subscriptions.  We were able to validate that several list prices provided in that quote matched the same list price in the Feb 2017 attached price list.  While this doesn?t confirm we have the latest price list it provides some support that it is still valid.   ?\tIn addition, to the programmatic reduced list price based on volume, in NPIs experience Elavon should also receive a discount off that.  30% would be a solid (not aggressive) discount target.  The caveat is if there?s some reason Riverbed doesn?t discount Aternity subscriptions similar to other SaaS subscriptions (NPIs recent experience was with SteelCentral AppInternals SaaS Core). ?\tElavon should seek a starting price of $2.55.  Software One may get a bit wily and indicate they need to use the annual volume of 19,200 which has a list price of $3.15 (tier is 10,000-29,999).  Additionally, a discount of 25-35% should be offered especially if this is a first-time purchase.  The table below shows these scenarios, the targets and targeted reductions.  These are quite significant.  While NPI admits to not having performed an Aternity-related review in the past we believe there?s enough findings to support Elavon seeking reductions or at least some rock solid explanations if the current offer is truly a good one.  ?\tNPI also recommends Elavon take a look at past discounts on any recent/prior Riverbed hardware purchases to see the historical discounts offered by Riverbed as this can support current targets. ?\tIt would be interesting to see what list price and discount are  being used to come up with the $6.15 offer. While it is possible the other two parts have list prices >$0 that aren?t being shown I?d push for clear evidence of that. ?\tRiverbed does not offer the best search tool to find partners and see their level within the ecosystem but SoftwareOne may not be the highest partner with Riverbed and this may be evidenced in their offer. http://partnerlocator.riverbed.com/ Searching in Georgia NPI didn?t see SoftwareOne show up in the list.  An even broader search didn?t find a hit either. The levels were Elite, Premier and Authorized.  Ask S1 if they?re a partner and their level.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the updated proposal from SAP for a global rollout. As detailed in the previous FMV report, and as compared to other market transactions, NPI still believes there is room for significant improvement in pricing. The pricing for Compensation, Performance and Succession are now in the range of FMV (with room for small improvement). The pricing for Learning and Employee Central, Workforce Analytics & Planning are still above FMV.  Overall, there is still room for improvement of about $3.6M which would bring the total cost over 5 years to $18.2M which is also closer to Oracle?s proposed pricing of $17.8M.  The table below has more details on the FMV price for the global rollout.  In terms of the concessions,  ?\tthe exchange rights offered are superior to the others we have seen at NPI.   o\tSAP routinely offers exchange rights, but these are usually within product families. o\tWe have seen only one other instance where they offered an exchange right across products.   o\tWe also see exchange rights capped (usually a certain number of users or a certain % of revenue). In this case, SAP has not subject the exchange rights to any caps. ?\tIf Aramark runs SAP ERP, there is greater flexibility to save money. There may be scope for more exchange rights with existing on-premise software. ?\tThe services credit provided is small ($350K) for a $20 M deal. Since SAP will be displacing all the incumbent HCM and learning software, Aramark will incur an additional cost of $3.86M in implementation fees to make this change.

        "current_narrative": "NPI has seen In the recent past, Altify has used the following discount table (for what? Single product?  Bundles?): 0 > 50 = 5% 51 > 150 = 15% 150 > 300 = 25% 300 > 400 = 32.50% 400 > 1500  = 40%  JCI?s pricing picks up from this point but starts at 41%, which NPI considers to be ABOVE FMV (for clarity, pricing is high, discounting is low).  Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the proposal from Oracle for Hyperion (Oracle Cloud Fusion) Enterprise Planning and Budgeting Cloud Services and Analytics Cloud and found the pricing to be above FMV with room for significant improvement.   Pricing Analysis  Oracle EPBCS  ?\tThe user Saas fee for Oracle Enterprise Planning and Budgeting Cloud Service is proposed at $175 per user per month.  ?\tThe EPBCS subscription lists at $250 per user per month.  ?\tThis translates to a discount of 30%. NPI has seen the market range of discounts for this software vary between 60% and 80% based on the size of the deal and the customer?s leverage.  For a purchase of this size and based on Metlife?s brand, size and spend with Oracle, as well as the (60 month) term of the deal, NPI would expect starting discounts to be 70%. NPI would expect a 30% discount for smaller sized deals of with a 1 year term. ?\tNPI would recommend a best-in-class discount target of 80% which would amount to savings of $4.1M for the 60 month contract. ?\tNPI would expect the test environment licenses as well as the storage discounts to match the per user EPBCS discount of 80%.   Oracle Analytics Cloud for Finance  ?\tOracle has provided deeper discounts of Oracle Analytics Cloud - Enterprise of 59%.  ?\tMonthly subscription price is proposed at $2,460.  ?\tThe subscription lists at $6000 per month. This translates to a discount of 59%. While this is a good starting point, NPI recommends a target discount between 70% and 80% for the subscriptions in this quote as well ?\tAchieving an 80% discount translates to savings of $2,046,265 for this purchase order.   Negotiation Leverage and Strategy  Oracle has siloed sales teams for each family of products which is why Metlife has 2 different quotes even though you are making both purchases at the same time. The sales reps are separately commissioned for the products assigned to them. The sales reps may or may not even know about the other purchases. It is to Oracle?s benefit to keep the sales teams disparate, in order to put a ceiling on the discounts based on the product family.  ?\tThe term of the subscriptions is a great leverage. Sales reps are compensated immediately based on the size of the deal, so a (larger) 60 month deal is more beneficial to the Oracle sales rep. Oracle also likes longer term deals because it locks in recurring revenue for the term of the contract, and Oracle?s revenue grows based on the customer?s growth over the 60 month term. Threat of reducing the term to 12 months , thus reducing the deal size greatly would incent Oracle to provide deeper discounts for a longer term deal. ?\tAsk Oracle to combine the quote (even though it may not be possible) and use the higher combined list price to get greater discount. ?\tUse the large HCM Cloud purchase from 2016 which had a discount of 87% to set the discount expectations for these purchases.  Close out comments: Gregg ? that was exactly it, we put some competition into the mix and we were able to execute by the end of the month.  Discount for EPBCS went up from 30 to 38% and Analytics went up from 58% to 68%.",

Review final pricing to ensure that support lands at 20% of the final hardware and software costs.    Negotiation Leverage and Strategy ?\tIn contrast to the prior negotiation tactics with Ivoxy, NPI recommends that rather than focusing on dollar amounts, SCH should work with Ivoxy and push them for the same discounts as previously received.  Because SCH now has a target discount to strive for, it sets a somewhat innocent target that needs to be met.   ?\tNPI would expect a pushback based on the prior deal was ~ 1 million greater in list pricing.  Reality is that after discounts are applied, the differences are within a few hundred thousand and still warrant discount levels greater than the current 64% on hardware and software. ?\t?New logo? opportunities help drive discounting a little deeper.  This deeper discounting may have occurred in the prior deal.  The position that SCH should maintain is that ?we can still easily choose to play a dual vendor strategy with our storage solutions if we can?t find the right solution at the right price?. ?\tSupport is currently quoted at 23% of the combined hardware and software costs.  NPI recommends that SCH target a 20% of net price of hardware and software. ?\tNetApp Q3 end is 10/31 and a quarter-end deal will typically allow for the best negotiation power with a promise to close this deal in Q3.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Apttus and found the proposal to be in the range of FMV with scope for improvement. ?\tApttus has proposed pricing of $35.25 for the Enterprise CLM edition.  ?\tThe pricing appears to be grandfathered from Aramark?s pricing for Contract Wizard which is one of the key functionalities in Enterprise CLM.  ?\tAramark?s current pricing of $39.75 for Contract Wizard for about 800 users represents a discount of 47%. ?\tFor 1386 users, the discount tier in the 2013 contract is 53% which translates to a price of $35.25 per user per month.  Below is the snapshot of Aramark?s discount tiers in the 2013 MSA.   NPI has seen pricing for Apttus CLM range between $22 and $60. NPI has observed that there is no consistency in pricing and there is large variance in the market. Pricing is not necessarily closely correlated with the purchase volume; it varies based on many factors and depends mainly on the presence of competition (especially at the time of the initial purchase) as well as customer?s requirements and negotiation leverage. NPI recommends target pricing of $33 per user per month for CLM Enterprise. Achieving a target of $33 per user per month translates to savings of $37K annually.  However, the fact that this is largely a renewal and hence there is a lack of competition reduces Aramark?s leverage. NPI also recommends that Aramark ask about tiered pricing and the associated price breaks as well as capped/flat out year pricing.

In addition to including Contract Wizard, which is one of the key functions, but not the only key function in the Enterprise CLM offering, it includes the other components that Aramark currently licenses, plus a good amount more which Aramark may find useful.",

        "customer_comments": "So this feedback is less about a benchmark and more about sharing the findings from some research we performed.  While we?ve done a ton of Riverbed hardware and support reviews and a few Riverbed SaaS reviews, none of these involved Aternity.  They?re an Israeli company that Riverbed bought toward the end of 2016.  http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-riverbed-acquires-israeli-saas-co-aternity-for-70m-1001142685  https://www.riverbed.com/press-releases/riverbed-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-leading-end-user-experience-monitoring-provider-aternity.html  The punchline is we believe there?s room for substantial savings.  We found it odd that the one year and three year offers were added together by SoftwareOne and that the multi-year offer didn?t reflect any improved discount.   ?\tElavon?s quotes didn?t include list pricing or provide any indication of the discount being offered ?\tIn NPIs experience, Riverbed has offered the same discount levels for hardware, software and SaaS subscriptions ?\tNPI believes we determined the list price for the primary Part Number ? ATNY-SAAS.  We also believe the other two Parts are zero dollar items.  This is an oddly-constructed set of parts as all three line items seem to just restate the same words just in a different order for the most part.  ?\tPart of our efforts were to validate that the two zero dollar items are typically no cost items.  While we found listings on CDW for the ATNY-SAAS product we got no hits at all when searching sites for pricing on the other two products. ?\tAdditionally, NPI has the attached price list from early 2017.  If you search ATNY-SAAS-PTO you will get only one hit for a zero dollar evaluation license.  If you search LIC-ATNY-SAAS you will get no hits.  If you search ATNY-SAAS you get a plethora of hits. o\tThe most interesting observation is the clear volume-based tiers offered by Aternity that don?t appear to be reflected in Elavon?s quote.  o\tThere are 8 volume tiers (they start at 500-999 because the subscription indicates 500 is the minimum quantity you can buy).  The list price at this level is $8.33/mo o\tElavon?s volume of 57,600 (one year volumes multiplied by three) slots into the second highest tier (50,000-99,999) which has a list price of $2.55 o\tElavon?s offer is $6.15.  This is a 26% discount from the lowest tier list price of $8.33. o\tIn February of 2018, NPI provided another client with a review of a purchase that included SaaS subscriptions.  We were able to validate that several list prices provided in that quote matched the same list price in the Feb 2017 attached price list.  While this doesn?t confirm we have the latest price list it provides some support that it is still valid.   ?\tIn addition, to the programmatic reduced list price based on volume, in NPIs experience Elavon should also receive a discount off that.  30% would be a solid (not aggressive) discount target.  The caveat is if there?s some reason Riverbed doesn?t discount Aternity subscriptions similar to other SaaS subscriptions (NPIs recent experience was with SteelCentral AppInternals SaaS Core). ?\tElavon should seek a starting price of $2.55.  Software One may get a bit wily and indicate they need to use the annual volume of 19,200 which has a list price of $3.15 (tier is 10,000-29,999).  Additionally, a discount of 25-35% should be offered especially if this is a first-time purchase.  The table below shows these scenarios, the targets and targeted reductions.  These are quite significant.  While NPI admits to not having performed an Aternity-related review in the past we believe there?s enough findings to support Elavon seeking reductions or at least some rock solid explanations if the current offer is truly a good one.  ?\tNPI also recommends Elavon take a look at past discounts on any recent/prior Riverbed hardware purchases to see the historical discounts offered by Riverbed as this can support current targets. ?\tIt would be interesting to see what list price and discount are  being used to come up with the $6.15 offer. While it is possible the other two parts have list prices >$0 that aren?t being shown I?d push for clear evidence of that. ?\tRiverbed does not offer the best search tool to find partners and see their level within the ecosystem but SoftwareOne may not be the highest partner with Riverbed and this may be evidenced in their offer. http://partnerlocator.riverbed.com/ Searching in Georgia NPI didn?t see SoftwareOne show up in the list.  An even broader search didn?t find a hit either. The levels were Elite, Premier and Authorized.  Ask S1 if they?re a partner and their level.",

The CDP world continues to grow at an amazing pace and is expected to become even more competitive (to the benefit of Intuit).    With that said, NPI would agree that your data leader has done a very good job at both negotiating and documenting the journey.  Based on the Segment deals we have seen and extrapolating a bit on the size of this deal, NPI concludes that this deal appears to be solidly Fair Market Value (FMV).  We believe that Intuit can move forward with confidence on this transaction.",

        "description": "CV:No docs yet... requested quote/proposal from Dianne.  Hope all is well! Thank you again for providing the pricing analysis for Adobe Analytics. I have 2 more requests for next week if your team has the capabilities to analyze market pricing for Segment for CDP- event collection/distribution and Tealium for tag management. I?ll send the Tealium request on another email.   We feel comfortable with the final proposal that we received. Our data leader has done an excellent job with the negotiation. However, we want to get your team?s thoughts if there are any negotiation leverage that we haven?t explored based on your customer?s dealings with Segment. Please see below the price negotiation journey that our leader provided. Please let me know if your team has expertise in analyzing CDP providers and if you have any questions. Thank you!     ? Current FY18 rate: $130K for 3M monthly active identifiers (e.g. cookie or authId). Identifier overages are expensive (we owe $70K and may owe as much as $114K by July). Basic enterprise service level. \"Data governance\" package not included (schema validation/enforcement, Lambda transformations, more coming). ? Offer 1 (Dec '17 for SBSEG marketing websites): $815K for 50M monthly active identifiers ? Offer 2 (Feb '18): $1.5M for 360M annual identifiers + \"data governance\" package. Previously Segment only offered monthly plans, and because of our seasonality we pressed for an annual cap instead. However, active identifier pricing is still terrible for planning because we have many anonymous Intuit experiences (marketing websites, invoice payment portal). So we pushed Segment over several conversations to offer annual event volume pricing to meet our needs. ? Offer 3 (Early Mar '18): $1.3M for 50B events + data governance free for 1 year ($300K after) + \"gold account\" service.  ? Offer 4 (Mid Mar '18) ? Segment is asking for 2 year agreement and deal by Apr 1 for the below: ? 3 mos free + overage debt forgiveness till now + \"gold account\" service + data governance free for 2 yrs + upcoming CDP profiles/audience product free for 1 year ($400K after) ? $1.05M for 80B events ? $1.2M for 100B events ? $1.3M for 120B events (for comparison, Intuit estimated 120B events will be sent to Adobe Analytics in FY19)   ? I gave some thoughtful reasons in asking for the following concessions: ? $100K cut off the top volume (120B) ? 1 year deal with Aug 1 start date (Segment really wants July 1 at least for the first year for a revenue recognition reason.) ? Exclude \"identify\" and \"group\" calls from event volumes (these are for setting user profile info, not really tracking events) ? Overage forgiveness for the rest of FY18 (they had only considered overages up until now) ? After a call with their sales team, this is Offer 5 (Mar 23, 2018) which has 4 options, all which include:  ? 126B events (to cover \"identify\" and \"group\" API calls, estimating 5% of calls)  ? Overage debt forgiveness through March (2 options cover the rest of FY18) ? \"Gold account\" high value customer status ? Data governance package included free for the duration of the term ? Profiles/audience product free through Dec 2018. $233K option to license through end of FY19. For 2 year agreements, $400K option for year 2 (this product will likely be priced $700-800K similar to competitors). 1. July 1 start. 13 months for $1.3M (w/ 10.5B extra events to cover July). Overage forgiveness through June. 2. Aug 1 start. 12 month agreement for $1.25M. (Overage fees assessed Apr-Jul, estimated $50K -- no upside over July 1 start) 3. July 1 start. 25 months for $1.3M for first year (w/ 10.5B extra events to cover July), $1.2M for second year (due Aug 1, 2019). Overage forgiveness through June. 4. Aug 1 start. 24 month agreement $1.2M each year. (Overage fees assessed Apr-Jul, estimated $50K)",

        "current_narrative": "NPI has seen In the recent past, Altify has used the following discount table (for what? Single product?  Bundles?): 0 > 50 = 5% 51 > 150 = 15% 150 > 300 = 25% 300 > 400 = 32.50% 400 > 1500  = 40%  JCI?s pricing picks up from this point but starts at 41%, which NPI considers to be ABOVE FMV (for clarity, pricing is high, discounting is low).  Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the proposal from Oracle for Hyperion (Oracle Cloud Fusion) Enterprise Planning and Budgeting Cloud Services and Analytics Cloud and found the pricing to be above FMV with room for significant improvement.   Pricing Analysis  Oracle EPBCS  ?\tThe user Saas fee for Oracle Enterprise Planning and Budgeting Cloud Service is proposed at $175 per user per month.  ?\tThe EPBCS subscription lists at $250 per user per month.  ?\tThis translates to a discount of 30%. NPI has seen the market range of discounts for this software vary between 60% and 80% based on the size of the deal and the customer?s leverage.  For a purchase of this size and based on Metlife?s brand, size and spend with Oracle, as well as the (60 month) term of the deal, NPI would expect starting discounts to be 70%. NPI would expect a 30% discount for smaller sized deals of with a 1 year term. ?\tNPI would recommend a best-in-class discount target of 80% which would amount to savings of $4.1M for the 60 month contract. ?\tNPI would expect the test environment licenses as well as the storage discounts to match the per user EPBCS discount of 80%.   Oracle Analytics Cloud for Finance  ?\tOracle has provided deeper discounts of Oracle Analytics Cloud - Enterprise of 59%.  ?\tMonthly subscription price is proposed at $2,460.  ?\tThe subscription lists at $6000 per month. This translates to a discount of 59%. While this is a good starting point, NPI recommends a target discount between 70% and 80% for the subscriptions in this quote as well ?\tAchieving an 80% discount translates to savings of $2,046,265 for this purchase order.   Negotiation Leverage and Strategy  Oracle has siloed sales teams for each family of products which is why Metlife has 2 different quotes even though you are making both purchases at the same time. The sales reps are separately commissioned for the products assigned to them. The sales reps may or may not even know about the other purchases. It is to Oracle?s benefit to keep the sales teams disparate, in order to put a ceiling on the discounts based on the product family.  ?\tThe term of the subscriptions is a great leverage. Sales reps are compensated immediately based on the size of the deal, so a (larger) 60 month deal is more beneficial to the Oracle sales rep. Oracle also likes longer term deals because it locks in recurring revenue for the term of the contract, and Oracle?s revenue grows based on the customer?s growth over the 60 month term. Threat of reducing the term to 12 months , thus reducing the deal size greatly would incent Oracle to provide deeper discounts for a longer term deal. ?\tAsk Oracle to combine the quote (even though it may not be possible) and use the higher combined list price to get greater discount. ?\tUse the large HCM Cloud purchase from 2016 which had a discount of 87% to set the discount expectations for these purchases.  Close out comments: Gregg ? that was exactly it, we put some competition into the mix and we were able to execute by the end of the month.

When customers reduce the deal size, Adobe invariably increases the pricing on the products which has not occurred here. ?\tCost reductions achieved including the cost savings from optimizing product count is 21% or $548K for the ETLA. After adjusting for volumes, the savings from reductions in per unit pricing only is 15% or $106K for the term of the ETLA. ?\tThe final product pricing is within FMV for the size of the deal.

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Apttus and found the proposal to be in the range of FMV with scope for improvement. ?\tApttus has proposed pricing of $35.25 for the Enterprise CLM edition.  ?\tThe pricing appears to be grandfathered from Aramark?s pricing for Contract Wizard which is one of the key functionalities in Enterprise CLM.  ?\tAramark?s current pricing of $39.75 for Contract Wizard for about 800 users represents a discount of 47%. ?\tFor 1386 users, the discount tier in the 2013 contract is 53% which translates to a price of $35.25 per user per month.  Below is the snapshot of Aramark?s discount tiers in the 2013 MSA.   NPI has seen pricing for Apttus CLM range between $22 and $60. NPI has observed that there is no consistency in pricing and there is large variance in the market. Pricing is not necessarily closely correlated with the purchase volume; it varies based on many factors and depends mainly on the presence of competition (especially at the time of the initial purchase) as well as customer?s requirements and negotiation leverage. NPI recommends target pricing of $33 per user per month for CLM Enterprise. Achieving a target of $33 per user per month translates to savings of $37K annually.  However, the fact that this is largely a renewal and hence there is a lack of competition reduces Aramark?s leverage. NPI also recommends that Aramark ask about tiered pricing and the associated price breaks as well as capped/flat out year pricing.

In addition to including Contract Wizard, which is one of the key functions, but not the only key function in the Enterprise CLM offering, it includes the other components that Aramark currently licenses, plus a good amount more which Aramark may find useful.",

        "customer_comments": "So this feedback is less about a benchmark and more about sharing the findings from some research we performed.  While we?ve done a ton of Riverbed hardware and support reviews and a few Riverbed SaaS reviews, none of these involved Aternity.  They?re an Israeli company that Riverbed bought toward the end of 2016.  http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-riverbed-acquires-israeli-saas-co-aternity-for-70m-1001142685  https://www.riverbed.com/press-releases/riverbed-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-leading-end-user-experience-monitoring-provider-aternity.html  The punchline is we believe there?s room for substantial savings.  We found it odd that the one year and three year offers were added together by SoftwareOne and that the multi-year offer didn?t reflect any improved discount.   ?\tElavon?s quotes didn?t include list pricing or provide any indication of the discount being offered ?\tIn NPIs experience, Riverbed has offered the same discount levels for hardware, software and SaaS subscriptions ?\tNPI believes we determined the list price for the primary Part Number ? ATNY-SAAS.  We also believe the other two Parts are zero dollar items.  This is an oddly-constructed set of parts as all three line items seem to just restate the same words just in a different order for the most part.  ?\tPart of our efforts were to validate that the two zero dollar items are typically no cost items.  While we found listings on CDW for the ATNY-SAAS product we got no hits at all when searching sites for pricing on the other two products. ?\tAdditionally, NPI has the attached price list from early 2017.  If you search ATNY-SAAS-PTO you will get only one hit for a zero dollar evaluation license.  If you search LIC-ATNY-SAAS you will get no hits.  If you search ATNY-SAAS you get a plethora of hits. o\tThe most interesting observation is the clear volume-based tiers offered by Aternity that don?t appear to be reflected in Elavon?s quote.  o\tThere are 8 volume tiers (they start at 500-999 because the subscription indicates 500 is the minimum quantity you can buy).  The list price at this level is $8.33/mo o\tElavon?s volume of 57,600 (one year volumes multiplied by three) slots into the second highest tier (50,000-99,999) which has a list price of $2.55 o\tElavon?s offer is $6.15.  This is a 26% discount from the lowest tier list price of $8.33. o\tIn February of 2018, NPI provided another client with a review of a purchase that included SaaS subscriptions.  We were able to validate that several list prices provided in that quote matched the same list price in the Feb 2017 attached price list.  While this doesn?t confirm we have the latest price list it provides some support that it is still valid.   ?\tIn addition, to the programmatic reduced list price based on volume, in NPIs experience Elavon should also receive a discount off that.  30% would be a solid (not aggressive) discount target.  The caveat is if there?s some reason Riverbed doesn?t discount Aternity subscriptions similar to other SaaS subscriptions (NPIs recent experience was with SteelCentral AppInternals SaaS Core). ?\tElavon should seek a starting price of $2.55.  Software One may get a bit wily and indicate they need to use the annual volume of 19,200 which has a list price of $3.15 (tier is 10,000-29,999).  Additionally, a discount of 25-35% should be offered especially if this is a first-time purchase.  The table below shows these scenarios, the targets and targeted reductions.  These are quite significant.  While NPI admits to not having performed an Aternity-related review in the past we believe there?s enough findings to support Elavon seeking reductions or at least some rock solid explanations if the current offer is truly a good one.  ?\tNPI also recommends Elavon take a look at past discounts on any recent/prior Riverbed hardware purchases to see the historical discounts offered by Riverbed as this can support current targets. ?\tIt would be interesting to see what list price and discount are  being used to come up with the $6.15 offer. While it is possible the other two parts have list prices >$0 that aren?t being shown I?d push for clear evidence of that. ?\tRiverbed does not offer the best search tool to find partners and see their level within the ecosystem but SoftwareOne may not be the highest partner with Riverbed and this may be evidenced in their offer. http://partnerlocator.riverbed.com/ Searching in Georgia NPI didn?t see SoftwareOne show up in the list.  An even broader search didn?t find a hit either. The levels were Elite, Premier and Authorized.  Ask S1 if they?re a partner and their level.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI has seen In the recent past, Altify has used the following discount table (for what? Single product?  Bundles?): 0 > 50 = 5% 51 > 150 = 15% 150 > 300 = 25% 300 > 400 = 32.50% 400 > 1500  = 40%  JCI?s pricing picks up from this point but starts at 41%, which NPI considers to be ABOVE FMV (for clarity, pricing is high, discounting is low).  Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "Most of the guideline recommendations on slide 2 in the VzW deck are basic recommendations that should be implemented. Similar recommendations should be obtained from AT&T for optimization.   For comparisons, it was good to bring in T-Mobile, however, we see most clients using them in limited cases due to coverage issues. Alternatively, NetApp should look at MetTel for comparative quotes. They are an MVNO that can be creative in the servicing of accounts such as this which ultimately drive costs down and create efficiencies. Please ask for further details.  It?s worth noting that the majority of cost savings in the cellular suite of services come from optimization efforts and that the observations below should be used as a guideline.  Discounts ?\tFor an account of this size, we work to achieve discounts of 22%-23% from Verizon Wireless. They appear to be offering 14%. ?\tSimilarly, we work toward AT&T discounts of 25% for an account this size. (No ATT proposal was shared.)  Activations Credits ?\tFor an account of your size, work to get the following activation credits o\tAT&T = $150 o\tVzW = $125 (in proposal, so OK) ?\tDon?t buy accessories from carriers.  For accessories, Verizon offers a 50% discount.  Even so, their discounted prices will be much higher than even standard retail pricing.  Plans (VzW) ?\tBusiness Unlimited data (all device types), we recommend that you push to achieve rates approaching $40 per month. ?\tBusiness Limited could go as low as $30 per month.  Pool optimization ?\tRecommend the buffer should be managed to ~10%. ?\tOne potential issue with the proposed plan distribution is management of the pool. With the amount of plan types being proposed, pool management can be problematic. You can save time, hassle, and cost by reducing the number of plans.  Make sure that the contract terms allow unlimited movement from one pricing plan to another in a given month.   Additional observations ?\tWe agree that Travel Pass should be added to all international roaming phones, as suggested in the proposal. ?\tOn the TCO, cell H8, you indicate an AT&T MARC of $6 MM ? does this include a substantial wireline spend?  Otherwise, you will not hit it, so don?t agree to it. ?\tFor true TCO calculation and proposal analysis, we strongly recommend to perform an independent cost assessment using recent actual data usage (available from the billing portals) by a 3rd party SME. Any time a provider recommends how to pay them less, their analysis should be fully scrutinized.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Apttus and found the proposal to be in the range of FMV with scope for improvement. ?\tApttus has proposed pricing of $35.25 for the Enterprise CLM edition.  ?\tThe pricing appears to be grandfathered from Aramark?s pricing for Contract Wizard which is one of the key functionalities in Enterprise CLM.  ?\tAramark?s current pricing of $39.75 for Contract Wizard for about 800 users represents a discount of 47%. ?\tFor 1386 users, the discount tier in the 2013 contract is 53% which translates to a price of $35.25 per user per month.  Below is the snapshot of Aramark?s discount tiers in the 2013 MSA.   NPI has seen pricing for Apttus CLM range between $22 and $60. NPI has observed that there is no consistency in pricing and there is large variance in the market. Pricing is not necessarily closely correlated with the purchase volume; it varies based on many factors and depends mainly on the presence of competition (especially at the time of the initial purchase) as well as customer?s requirements and negotiation leverage. NPI recommends target pricing of $33 per user per month for CLM Enterprise. Achieving a target of $33 per user per month translates to savings of $37K annually.  However, the fact that this is largely a renewal and hence there is a lack of competition reduces Aramark?s leverage. NPI also recommends that Aramark ask about tiered pricing and the associated price breaks as well as capped/flat out year pricing.

In addition to including Contract Wizard, which is one of the key functions, but not the only key function in the Enterprise CLM offering, it includes the other components that Aramark currently licenses, plus a good amount more which Aramark may find useful.",

Targets ?\tNPI recommends targeting a ?freeze? on 2017 pricing at ~$111,872. ?\tNPI typically will NOT see a roll-back on pricing, yet will often see a ?freeze? to the prior years? renewal rate. ?\tIf Guitar Center is willing to consider a multi-year deal, a potential roll-back may be possible. ?\tA conservative $110K baseline on a multi-year deal with no annual increase for 3 years will lock in pricing and save an estimated $26,159 using an assumed 3% Y/Y increase (2018: $115,228, 2019: $118,685, 2020: $122,246) ?\tThe realized savings from reducing the proposed $115,682 spend to a multi-year $110K spend would result in a $26,613 savings in comparison to a business as usual 3% Y/Y increase (shown below).

Both JDA and Guitar Center have ?wins? by securing a multi-year deal.  JDA has stability in revenue and Guitar Center has stability in budgeting and pricing. ?\tA $106K - $110K is ?fair and reasonable? compromise for both parties. ?\tPoint out that support costs have increased 31% since the original contract. ?\tBoth JDA and Guitar Center have acted in good faith in the annual increases of the past.  Yet? The increases over the years have begun to become somewhat of a problematic issue.

        "current_narrative": "NPI has seen In the recent past, Altify has used the following discount table (for what? Single product?  Bundles?): 0 > 50 = 5% 51 > 150 = 15% 150 > 300 = 25% 300 > 400 = 32.50% 400 > 1500  = 40%  JCI?s pricing picks up from this point but starts at 41%, which NPI considers to be ABOVE FMV (for clarity, pricing is high, discounting is low).  Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "Most of the guideline recommendations on slide 2 in the VzW deck are basic recommendations that should be implemented. Similar recommendations should be obtained from AT&T for optimization.   For comparisons, it was good to bring in T-Mobile, however, we see most clients using them in limited cases due to coverage issues. Alternatively, NetApp should look at MetTel for comparative quotes. They are an MVNO that can be creative in the servicing of accounts such as this which ultimately drive costs down and create efficiencies. Please ask for further details.  It?s worth noting that the majority of cost savings in the cellular suite of services come from optimization efforts and that the observations below should be used as a guideline.  Discounts ?\tFor an account of this size, we work to achieve discounts of 22%-23% from Verizon Wireless. They appear to be offering 14%. ?\tSimilarly, we work toward AT&T discounts of 25% for an account this size. (No ATT proposal was shared.)  Activations Credits ?\tFor an account of your size, work to get the following activation credits o\tAT&T = $150 o\tVzW = $125 (in proposal, so OK) ?\tDon?t buy accessories from carriers.  For accessories, Verizon offers a 50% discount.  Even so, their discounted prices will be much higher than even standard retail pricing.  Plans (VzW) ?\tBusiness Unlimited data (all device types), we recommend that you push to achieve rates approaching $40 per month. ?\tBusiness Limited could go as low as $30 per month.  Pool optimization ?\tRecommend the buffer should be managed to ~10%. ?\tOne potential issue with the proposed plan distribution is management of the pool. With the amount of plan types being proposed, pool management can be problematic. You can save time, hassle, and cost by reducing the number of plans.  Make sure that the contract terms allow unlimited movement from one pricing plan to another in a given month.   Additional observations ?\tWe agree that Travel Pass should be added to all international roaming phones, as suggested in the proposal. ?\tOn the TCO, cell H8, you indicate an AT&T MARC of $6 MM ? does this include a substantial wireline spend?  Otherwise, you will not hit it, so don?t agree to it. ?\tFor true TCO calculation and proposal analysis, we strongly recommend to perform an independent cost assessment using recent actual data usage (available from the billing portals) by a 3rd party SME. Any time a provider recommends how to pay them less, their analysis should be fully scrutinized.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Apttus and found the proposal to be in the range of FMV with scope for improvement. ?\tApttus has proposed pricing of $35.25 for the Enterprise CLM edition.  ?\tThe pricing appears to be grandfathered from Aramark?s pricing for Contract Wizard which is one of the key functionalities in Enterprise CLM.  ?\tAramark?s current pricing of $39.75 for Contract Wizard for about 800 users represents a discount of 47%. ?\tFor 1386 users, the discount tier in the 2013 contract is 53% which translates to a price of $35.25 per user per month.  Below is the snapshot of Aramark?s discount tiers in the 2013 MSA.   NPI has seen pricing for Apttus CLM range between $22 and $60. NPI has observed that there is no consistency in pricing and there is large variance in the market. Pricing is not necessarily closely correlated with the purchase volume; it varies based on many factors and depends mainly on the presence of competition (especially at the time of the initial purchase) as well as customer?s requirements and negotiation leverage. NPI recommends target pricing of $33 per user per month for CLM Enterprise. Achieving a target of $33 per user per month translates to savings of $37K annually.  However, the fact that this is largely a renewal and hence there is a lack of competition reduces Aramark?s leverage. NPI also recommends that Aramark ask about tiered pricing and the associated price breaks as well as capped/flat out year pricing. License Type\tQty\tPrice\tTerm\tTotal Annual Price\tTotal Price\tTarget Price\tTarget Annual Price\tAnnual Savings\tTarget Total Price\tTotal Savings Enterprise CLM Edition\t786\t$35.25 \t48\t$332,478 \t$1,329,912 \t$33 \t$311,256 \t$21,222 \t$1,245,024 \t$84,888  Enterprise CLM Edition\t600\t$35.25 \t47\t$253,800 \t$994,050 \t$33 \t$237,600 \t$16,200 \t$930,600 \t$63,450   Overall, the Enterprise CLM offering is a better value for Aramark (as compared to the current cost of Contract Wizard licenses).  In addition to including Contract Wizard, which is one of the key functions, but not the only key function in the Enterprise CLM offering, it includes the other components that Aramark currently licenses, plus a good amount more which Aramark may find useful.",

While we have not seen a ton of Vertiv deals, we HAVE seen a few renewals so we were able to draw some comparisons with your pricing.  To save the suspense, NPI finds the pricing to be at Fair Market Value (FMV).    Our FMV assessment is largely based on the statement in the deal profile, that Vertiv Services has ?reduced pricing to the same dollar values as in 2014.?  Typically we see Vertiv renewals that will have a 3% - 7% increase year over year.  In the Vertiv renewal deals that NPI has reviewed, we have not seen Vertiv offer pricing below the previous renewal or purchase.  Therefore, keeping pricing flat (or same dollar value if equipment has changed) is typically the best result for this type of renewal.  Based on the information that NPI has, we believe this pricing is FMV and SCH could move forward with confidence.",

Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the proposed rates from KPMG and determined that the pricing and rates were above Fair Market Value (FMV), based on the size of the project. with scope for improvement in the pricing. The savings opportunity is about $1.2M for the engagement and translates to 8.2% of the proposed cost.  Pricing Analysis ?\tThe blended rate for the SOW is $206/hour. Blended rates for similar projects which are based in the US with no offshore component are typically between $195/hour and $225/hour based on the number of offshore hours, mix and seniority of the resources, etc.  NPI recommends a target blended rate no greater than $200/hour. ?\tOverall, benchmarking and negotiating rates and volume discounts from the Big 4 consulting firms involve as much art as science because of their organization structure? they are partnership based firms. o Between the 4 firms, there are 10,000 + partners whose annual income is based on revenue/profits from their customers. The partners, therefore, have some degree of autonomy where pricing/billing decisions are concerned.  ?\tSome of the firms, like Deloitte, PWC and KPMG, have a standard or list price for the rates that they sometimes reveal to their customers. This sets the ceiling on the rate. Actual (negotiated) rates are discounted off of these rates. Other firms, like E&Y, don?t usually reveal a set of standard rates.  ?\tIn addition to the rates, volume discounts and tiers are also negotiable and depend on the customer?s leverage. These discounts can be applied in various ways.  1)\tA discount is applied upfront to the committed spend in the SOW. If the customer has a number of ongoing projects with the customer, 2)\t credit provided at the end of the year based on the actual spend. This can be in the form of a check (this is rare). 3)\tVolume discount is applied to the future spend based on the previous year?s spend.   Targets  NPI has provided the target fair market value rates for all the roles in the attached excel sheet.   ?\tThe categories/roles which are within FMV are highlighted in green. ?\tThe rows highlighted in yellow are those where there is scope for improvement in the rates. ?\tAchieving these target rates brings the blended rate down to $197.6 per hour and translates to savings of $567K.  ?\tNPI also recommends negotiating a volume discount of 5% based on the large spend. NPI has seen KPMG offer a discount of 5% off the negotiated cost of the SOW(s) if the customer commits to large spend volumes. Achieving an additional 5% discount translates to savings of $669K. ?\tThe PMO effort is rather high as compared to other similar projects. NPI recommends moving 30% of PM hours to other areas.",

While we have not seen a ton of Vertiv deals, we HAVE seen a few renewals so we were able to draw some comparisons with your pricing.  To save the suspense, NPI finds the pricing to be at Fair Market Value (FMV).    Our FMV assessment is largely based on the statement in the deal profile, that Vertiv Services has ?reduced pricing to the same dollar values as in 2014.?  Typically we see Vertiv renewals that will have a 3% - 7% increase year over year.  In the Vertiv renewal deals that NPI has reviewed, we have not seen Vertiv offer pricing below the previous renewal or purchase.  Therefore, keeping pricing flat (or same dollar value if equipment has changed) is typically the best result for this type of renewal.  Based on the information that NPI has, we believe this pricing is FMV and SCH could move forward with confidence.",

Bundles?): 0 > 50 = 5% 51 > 150 = 15% 150 > 300 = 25% 300 > 400 = 32.50% 400 > 1500  = 40%  JCI?s pricing picks up from this point but starts at 41%, which NPI considers to be ABOVE FMV (for clarity, pricing is high, discounting is low).  Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the proposed rates from KPMG and determined that the pricing and rates were above Fair Market Value (FMV), based on the size of the project. with scope for improvement in the pricing. The savings opportunity is about $1.2M for the engagement and translates to 8.2% of the proposed cost.  Pricing Analysis ?\tThe blended rate for the SOW is $206/hour. Blended rates for similar projects which are based in the US with no offshore component are typically between $195/hour and $225/hour based on the number of offshore hours, mix and seniority of the resources, etc.  NPI recommends a target blended rate no greater than $200/hour. ?\tOverall, benchmarking and negotiating rates and volume discounts from the Big 4 consulting firms involve as much art as science because of their organization structure? they are partnership based firms. o Between the 4 firms, there are 10,000 + partners whose annual income is based on revenue/profits from their customers. The partners, therefore, have some degree of autonomy where pricing/billing decisions are concerned.  ?\tSome of the firms, like Deloitte, PWC and KPMG, have a standard or list price for the rates that they sometimes reveal to their customers. This sets the ceiling on the rate. Actual (negotiated) rates are discounted off of these rates. Other firms, like E&Y, don?t usually reveal a set of standard rates.  ?\tIn addition to the rates, volume discounts and tiers are also negotiable and depend on the customer?s leverage. These discounts can be applied in various ways.  1)\tA discount is applied upfront to the committed spend in the SOW. If the customer has a number of ongoing projects with the customer, 2)\t credit provided at the end of the year based on the actual spend. This can be in the form of a check (this is rare). 3)\tVolume discount is applied to the future spend based on the previous year?s spend.   Targets  NPI has provided the target fair market value rates for all the roles in the attached excel sheet.   ?\tThe categories/roles which are within FMV are highlighted in green. ?\tThe rows highlighted in yellow are those where there is scope for improvement in the rates. ?\tAchieving these target rates brings the blended rate down to $197.6 per hour and translates to savings of $567K.  ?\tNPI also recommends negotiating a volume discount of 5% based on the large spend. NPI has seen KPMG offer a discount of 5% off the negotiated cost of the SOW(s) if the customer commits to large spend volumes. Achieving an additional 5% discount translates to savings of $669K. ?\tThe PMO effort is rather high as compared to other similar projects. NPI recommends moving 30% of PM hours to other areas.",

Both JDA and Guitar Center have ?wins? by securing a multi-year deal.  JDA has stability in revenue and Guitar Center has stability in budgeting and pricing. ?\tA $106K - $110K is ?fair and reasonable? compromise for both parties. ?\tPoint out that support costs have increased 31% since the original contract. ?\tBoth JDA and Guitar Center have acted in good faith in the annual increases of the past.  Yet? The increases over the years have begun to become somewhat of a problematic issue.

While we have not seen a ton of Vertiv deals, we HAVE seen a few renewals so we were able to draw some comparisons with your pricing.  To save the suspense, NPI finds the pricing to be at Fair Market Value (FMV).    Our FMV assessment is largely based on the statement in the deal profile, that Vertiv Services has ?reduced pricing to the same dollar values as in 2014.?  Typically we see Vertiv renewals that will have a 3% - 7% increase year over year.  In the Vertiv renewal deals that NPI has reviewed, we have not seen Vertiv offer pricing below the previous renewal or purchase.  Therefore, keeping pricing flat (or same dollar value if equipment has changed) is typically the best result for this type of renewal.  Based on the information that NPI has, we believe this pricing is FMV and SCH could move forward with confidence.",

Previously, JCI?s discount from list has largely been at 59% off of list, with the exception of order 2, where JCI rec?d 76% off of list. The matrix laid out in the initial contract for JCI was very aggressive, relative to other clients and yet, JCI was actually priced into the 3rd tier, 3K-5K licenses, despite having a collective license pool of only 1,642 licenses, placing JCI in the 2nd pricing tier.",
        "customer_comments": "The lever to be pulled with Altify is that there is growing competition in this space and while their solution may be cutting edge, there are pricing values to be found with other vendors that offer most of the same features that they do. Were JCI to only be increasing the subscription 2-3x, NPI envisions that JCI would top out at discounting between 65-75% or a subscription base of $2.3-$3.3M annually, still an enviable position for most clients.  Based on the 10x license pool that JCI is projecting, (just under 16K licenses), NPI is confident that JCI can push past the discount schedule previously provided to as high as 85-90% off of list. With that type of projected growth, the message to Altify is a concern over being penalized for growing the solution organically.  The believe is that if JCI were purchasing that number of licenses now, you would see significantly better pricing.  Why should you be penalized for growing the solution organically to get up to the 16K licenses.   NOTE: Closing for data cleanup... no final docs.",

        "current_narrative": "Synactive?s Liquid UI is a niche product, and NPI has seen only a couple of these types of transactions for comparison.  There is also very little competition ? primary competitors are UX consultants who customize SAP? often through GuiXT.      However, with the shift to SAP Cloud, NPI believes this product may be nearing end of life.   Synactive Inc. has not been very active from a marketing perspective.  Very little  ?current? news is available During 2016, their marketing appeared to go dark ? per their website, no press releases were published During this year 2017, one press release which highlighted a customer implementation The Liquid UI facebook page has not been updated in over a year; last update was June 2, 2016   Price Analysis In the few deals that we have seen, 18% for support seems to be the standard rate for GuiXT. We have seen the Developer Suite priced as low as $10,200,  REI?s $10,943 price is within Fair Market Value (FMV). We have seen Desktop Suite priced as low as $175 per license, REI?s $150.68 for 1600 licenses is slightly below what we have seen.   So there are lower prices that REI could have paid for licenses and hence, lower support costs, but even with the lowest license pricing that NPI has seen, the total cost of this renewal would reduce by only $1,100.   Overall, this renewal is largely within FMV with room for very small improvement.  Considering that these renewals have happened for years with little or no increase, it is unlikely that Synactive would come down on this pricing.",

        "current_narrative": "Original feedback via email... followed up with FMV report.  Hey Jack,    I have finally been able to go through the purchase docs you provided and reconcile as much as I could with the maintenance contract you are currently under.  I am sure it is no surprise that your pricing across all of your add-on purchases has been all-over-the-place: ? In the six purchases you sent over (ranging from 2008 ? 2013), discounting on the License product (71000383) ranges between 35% (2011) down to 10% (2012).  When taken alone, where each transaction is below $100K, 35% discounting would be at the low end of Fair Market Value (FMV) ? for clarity, pricing is a little high, discounting is a little below what we would expect. ? The support for the licenses in these six purchases ? as a percentage of the net license cost ? range from 17% of the net license (2012) to 25% of the net license cost (2011).  Once again, taken as stand-alone <$100K purchases, 20% of net license cost is FMV.  In the six deals you sent over, the average discount on the licenses is ~26% and support is an average 22% of the net license cost.  If we apply these numbers to your annual $375,978 maintenance renewal, this would mean that you have purchased ~$1.7M in Software ($2.3M list price at 26% discounting) from McKesson over the years.  This brings NPI to two thoughts: ? If you were spending $1.7M with McKesson in a single purchase, NPI would recommend targeting discounts on licenses between 65% - 75% and support costs should be between 15% - 20% of the net license cost. ? While we would not expect you hit 65% - 75% discounting on these smaller purchases over time, NPI does not believe that Evergreen Health should be penalized for growing the solution organically the way that you have.  You are paying a very high premium for this amount of support.  Caveat: The above analysis is based off of the small sample of deals that you sent over.  It is possible that Evergreen received better discounting and better support percentages on some of the other deals that NPI has not seen ? it is also possible that you received worse discounts and less favorable discount percentages.  The challenge comes with the 2-year agreement that you are currently in.  You _are_ pretty much locked in to that and McKesson won?t be anxious to renegotiate this mid-term, especially since you will want to significantly reduce it (NPI believes the target cost for this maintenance should be ~$162K).  In order to get McKesson to rework this agreement midway through, you will probably have to agree to a longer term deal, or make a sizable new purchase with them.",

We signed a two year agreement last year that froze maintenance increases through 2018.  These contracts generally renew in January.  We have been highly dissatisfied with their support, the software stability, and feature functionality delivered.  Last year, we sent them a RFI informing them we would be shopping for a potential replacement to their software.  The timing of that replacement was moved to 2018.  I wanted to check to see if this would be a candidate for NPI services, or whether the attached amendment puts Evergreen is a difficult negotiating position.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks!",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the proposed rates from KPMG and determined that the pricing and rates were above Fair Market Value (FMV), based on the size of the project. with scope for improvement in the pricing. The savings opportunity is about $1.2M for the engagement and translates to 8.2% of the proposed cost.  Pricing Analysis ?\tThe blended rate for the SOW is $206/hour. Blended rates for similar projects which are based in the US with no offshore component are typically between $195/hour and $225/hour based on the number of offshore hours, mix and seniority of the resources, etc.  NPI recommends a target blended rate no greater than $200/hour. ?\tOverall, benchmarking and negotiating rates and volume discounts from the Big 4 consulting firms involve as much art as science because of their organization structure? they are partnership based firms. o Between the 4 firms, there are 10,000 + partners whose annual income is based on revenue/profits from their customers. The partners, therefore, have some degree of autonomy where pricing/billing decisions are concerned.  ?\tSome of the firms, like Deloitte, PWC and KPMG, have a standard or list price for the rates that they sometimes reveal to their customers. This sets the ceiling on the rate. Actual (negotiated) rates are discounted off of these rates. Other firms, like E&Y, don?t usually reveal a set of standard rates.  ?\tIn addition to the rates, volume discounts and tiers are also negotiable and depend on the customer?s leverage. These discounts can be applied in various ways.  1)\tA discount is applied upfront to the committed spend in the SOW. If the customer has a number of ongoing projects with the customer, 2)\t credit provided at the end of the year based on the actual spend. This can be in the form of a check (this is rare). 3)\tVolume discount is applied to the future spend based on the previous year?s spend.   Targets  NPI has provided the target fair market value rates for all the roles in the attached excel sheet.   ?\tThe categories/roles which are within FMV are highlighted in green. ?\tThe rows highlighted in yellow are those where there is scope for improvement in the rates. ?\tAchieving these target rates brings the blended rate down to $197.6 per hour and translates to savings of $567K.  ?\tNPI also recommends negotiating a volume discount of 5% based on the large spend. NPI has seen KPMG offer a discount of 5% off the negotiated cost of the SOW(s) if the customer commits to large spend volumes. Achieving an additional 5% discount translates to savings of $669K. ?\tThe PMO effort is rather high as compared to other similar projects. NPI recommends moving 30% of PM hours to other areas.",

A 42% discount is the standard Gold Partner discount which is basically the minimum discount anyone receives, so you are not much more than that.  I do not know your historical discounts with Cisco which could be leverage if you have seen higher than this.  We see discounting on products like these ranging between 47-60%.  The higher discounts are for much larger deals ($1M+) so 50% is not unreasonable at all, I would even aim a bit higher and see what they will do.    The key to this is to discuss it with your Cisco rep if you can.  Presidio only makes 3-4% of the list price, so my assumption is that Presidio got a 48-49% discount and passed the 45% to you.  The Cisco rep needs to extend more discounting to pass through Presidio for you.",

        "current_narrative": "Original feedback via email... followed up with FMV report.  Hey Jack,    I have finally been able to go through the purchase docs you provided and reconcile as much as I could with the maintenance contract you are currently under.  I am sure it is no surprise that your pricing across all of your add-on purchases has been all-over-the-place: ? In the six purchases you sent over (ranging from 2008 ? 2013), discounting on the License product (71000383) ranges between 35% (2011) down to 10% (2012).  When taken alone, where each transaction is below $100K, 35% discounting would be at the low end of Fair Market Value (FMV) ? for clarity, pricing is a little high, discounting is a little below what we would expect. ? The support for the licenses in these six purchases ? as a percentage of the net license cost ? range from 17% of the net license (2012) to 25% of the net license cost (2011).  Once again, taken as stand-alone <$100K purchases, 20% of net license cost is FMV.  In the six deals you sent over, the average discount on the licenses is ~26% and support is an average 22% of the net license cost.  If we apply these numbers to your annual $375,978 maintenance renewal, this would mean that you have purchased ~$1.7M in Software ($2.3M list price at 26% discounting) from McKesson over the years.  This brings NPI to two thoughts: ? If you were spending $1.7M with McKesson in a single purchase, NPI would recommend targeting discounts on licenses between 65% - 75% and support costs should be between 15% - 20% of the net license cost. ? While we would not expect you hit 65% - 75% discounting on these smaller purchases over time, NPI does not believe that Evergreen Health should be penalized for growing the solution organically the way that you have.  You are paying a very high premium for this amount of support.  Caveat: The above analysis is based off of the small sample of deals that you sent over.  It is possible that Evergreen received better discounting and better support percentages on some of the other deals that NPI has not seen ? it is also possible that you received worse discounts and less favorable discount percentages.  The challenge comes with the 2-year agreement that you are currently in.  You _are_ pretty much locked in to that and McKesson won?t be anxious to renegotiate this mid-term, especially since you will want to significantly reduce it (NPI believes the target cost for this maintenance should be ~$162K).  In order to get McKesson to rework this agreement midway through, you will probably have to agree to a longer term deal, or make a sizable new purchase with them.",

        "description": "All,  We have several contracts with McKesson (now Change Healthcare) for software related to their homecare application. We signed a two year agreement last year that froze maintenance increases through 2018.  These contracts generally renew in January.  We have been highly dissatisfied with their support, the software stability, and feature functionality delivered.  Last year, we sent them a RFI informing them we would be shopping for a potential replacement to their software.  The timing of that replacement was moved to 2018.  I wanted to check to see if this would be a candidate for NPI services, or whether the attached amendment puts Evergreen is a difficult negotiating position.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks!",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the renewal from Adobe and found the renewal pricing to be at Fair Market Value (FMV).   Adobe Analytics  ?\tGiven the volume of calls per month, for the Standard Analytics (primary), our Fair Market Value (FMV) range for 250 - 400 Million Server Calls per Month is $100 - $187. Pricing varies based on volumes but also on the mix of marketing cloud products being purchased and total spend size. REI is getting great pricing which is at the low end of the range of FMV because REI is purchasing Adobe Target. The expanding volumes also added leverage to lower pricing. ?\tThe overall market range for Analytics (primary) varies between $25 and $1,100 based on volume and term.  ?\tA three-year term with no early termination is now the standard from Adobe.  It wasn?t always this way.  In the past AEs were only paid on first year subscription value and so they were fine doing one-year deals but now they are comped on the whole term so of course three years has become the de facto norm. REI has a 2-year option, but if REI is willing to sign up for a 3-year term, they add to the negotiation leverage to get an additional 5% -10% off of current pricing. ?\tIn the past, Adobe would charge more for overages but they?ve moved away from this and it is now typically flat unless the volume is increasing y-o-y in which case they will reduce the pricing (which is the case with REI). ?\tCost of Adobe analytics secondary calls is invariably 50% of Analytics Primary rates and this is FMV.  Additional Concessions  ?\tWe?ve seen Adobe provide these additional concessions for Analytics ?\tNet 45 days payment instead of the standard net 30 ?\tHaving a three-year bucket of server calls that allows you to essentially rollover your calls vs. use each year.  This is a rare concession.  Generally, clients grow and this presents another sale for Adobe and clients leave calls on the table from earlier parts of their contract.  This would be a great risk mitigator for REI but is rarely approved.    Adobe Target Premium  ?\tThe overall market range for Adobe Target Premium varies between $35 and $1,100 based on volume and term.  ?\tFor a volume of around 1500, $268 - $256 is within FMV.",

In summary, NPI believes that there is potential for savings averaging about 4% for the roles in the rate card.  Consulting Rates in the Enterprise Data Management solutions space (including Data Management and Data governance etc.) command a premium. Niche companies such as Utopia, WCI, SAS, T/DG and several others provide consulting services specific to this area. Larger Consulting companies like the Big 4 as well as Accenture also provide these services, but their blended rate is 5% ? 20% higher based on the project. Global IT consultants such as TCS, Infosys etc. typically bill a much lower hourly rate for their consultants (sub $150 per hour for onshore rates).",

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  You mentioned that you needed this last week, but with the other deals that NPI was reviewing for Intuit, we were only able to get to this review this week.  I hope this information is still useful for you.  NPI reviewed Intuit?s Elastic purchase last year and we found the pricing to be ABOVE Fair market Value (FMV).  The pricing was initially offered with a 45% discounting and ultimately wound up at 61% discounting, or $2,886/node.  However, the discounting is misleading because the list price changed from $5,500 in the initial quotes to $7,400 in the final pricing.  Now in this year?s proposal, the list price is $4,400.  From what NPI can tell, all of this pricing has been for the same Gold level Subscription product.  Intuit may want to inquire as to why the list price has had such variation between these proposals.  In last year?s feedback, NPI recommended targeting $2,200 per node on a 3-year commitment and that recommendation holds true for the current purchase.  A 1-year renewal should see per node pricing closer to $2,500/node.  This puts NPI?s recommended targets at $100K for a 40-node, 1-year renewal, and $220K/year for a 100-node, 3-year renewal.  The current offer has a 3-year commitment at $2,156/node and NPI would consider that to be FMV.",

        "current_narrative": "Original feedback via email... followed up with FMV report.  Hey Jack,    I have finally been able to go through the purchase docs you provided and reconcile as much as I could with the maintenance contract you are currently under.  I am sure it is no surprise that your pricing across all of your add-on purchases has been all-over-the-place: ? In the six purchases you sent over (ranging from 2008 ? 2013), discounting on the License product (71000383) ranges between 35% (2011) down to 10% (2012).  When taken alone, where each transaction is below $100K, 35% discounting would be at the low end of Fair Market Value (FMV) ? for clarity, pricing is a little high, discounting is a little below what we would expect. ? The support for the licenses in these six purchases ? as a percentage of the net license cost ? range from 17% of the net license (2012) to 25% of the net license cost (2011).  Once again, taken as stand-alone <$100K purchases, 20% of net license cost is FMV.  In the six deals you sent over, the average discount on the licenses is ~26% and support is an average 22% of the net license cost.  If we apply these numbers to your annual $375,978 maintenance renewal, this would mean that you have purchased ~$1.7M in Software ($2.3M list price at 26% discounting) from McKesson over the years.  This brings NPI to two thoughts: ? If you were spending $1.7M with McKesson in a single purchase, NPI would recommend targeting discounts on licenses between 65% - 75% and support costs should be between 15% - 20% of the net license cost. ? While we would not expect you hit 65% - 75% discounting on these smaller purchases over time, NPI does not believe that Evergreen Health should be penalized for growing the solution organically the way that you have.  You are paying a very high premium for this amount of support.  Caveat: The above analysis is based off of the small sample of deals that you sent over.  It is possible that Evergreen received better discounting and better support percentages on some of the other deals that NPI has not seen ? it is also possible that you received worse discounts and less favorable discount percentages.  The challenge comes with the 2-year agreement that you are currently in.  You _are_ pretty much locked in to that and McKesson won?t be anxious to renegotiate this mid-term, especially since you will want to significantly reduce it (NPI believes the target cost for this maintenance should be ~$162K).  In order to get McKesson to rework this agreement midway through, you will probably have to agree to a longer term deal, or make a sizable new purchase with them.",

        "description": "All,  We have several contracts with McKesson (now Change Healthcare) for software related to their homecare application. We signed a two year agreement last year that froze maintenance increases through 2018.  These contracts generally renew in January.  We have been highly dissatisfied with their support, the software stability, and feature functionality delivered.  Last year, we sent them a RFI informing them we would be shopping for a potential replacement to their software.  The timing of that replacement was moved to 2018.  I wanted to check to see if this would be a candidate for NPI services, or whether the attached amendment puts Evergreen is a difficult negotiating position.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks!",

Consulting Rates in the Enterprise Data Management solutions space (including Data Management and Data governance etc.) command a premium. Niche companies such as Utopia, WCI, SAS, T/DG and several others provide consulting services specific to this area. Larger Consulting companies like the Big 4 as well as Accenture also provide these services, but their blended rate is 5% ? 20% higher based on the project.

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  You mentioned that you needed this last week, but with the other deals that NPI was reviewing for Intuit, we were only able to get to this review this week.  I hope this information is still useful for you.  NPI reviewed Intuit?s Elastic purchase last year and we found the pricing to be ABOVE Fair market Value (FMV).  The pricing was initially offered with a 45% discounting and ultimately wound up at 61% discounting, or $2,886/node.  However, the discounting is misleading because the list price changed from $5,500 in the initial quotes to $7,400 in the final pricing.  Now in this year?s proposal, the list price is $4,400.  From what NPI can tell, all of this pricing has been for the same Gold level Subscription product.  Intuit may want to inquire as to why the list price has had such variation between these proposals.  In last year?s feedback, NPI recommended targeting $2,200 per node on a 3-year commitment and that recommendation holds true for the current purchase.  A 1-year renewal should see per node pricing closer to $2,500/node.  This puts NPI?s recommended targets at $100K for a 40-node, 1-year renewal, and $220K/year for a 100-node, 3-year renewal.  The current offer has a 3-year commitment at $2,156/node and NPI would consider that to be FMV.",

Review final pricing to ensure that support lands at 20% of the final hardware and software costs.    Negotiation Leverage and Strategy ?\tIn contrast to the prior negotiation tactics with Ivoxy, NPI recommends that rather than focusing on dollar amounts, SCH should work with Ivoxy and push them for the same discounts as previously received.  Because SCH now has a target discount to strive for, it sets a somewhat innocent target that needs to be met.   ?\tNPI would expect a pushback based on the prior deal was ~ 1 million greater in list pricing.  Reality is that after discounts are applied, the differences are within a few hundred thousand and still warrant discount levels greater than the current 64% on hardware and software. ?\t?New logo? opportunities help drive discounting a little deeper.  This deeper discounting may have occurred in the prior deal.  The position that SCH should maintain is that ?we can still easily choose to play a dual vendor strategy with our storage solutions if we can?t find the right solution at the right price?. ?\tSupport is currently quoted at 23% of the combined hardware and software costs.  NPI recommends that SCH target a 20% of net price of hardware and software. ?\tNetApp Q3 end is 10/31 and a quarter-end deal will typically allow for the best negotiation power with a promise to close this deal in Q3.",

Over the past year, we have seen a number of Hearsay purchases and renewals and we have onboarded an Advisor (recent, former Hearsay salesperson) who is able to give us additional help in reviewing these transactions.    NPI?s FMV assessment is attached.  High-level: current agreement pricing is solid ? if COUNTRY is able to make a multi-year commitment then there may be savings available on this proposal.",

        "current_narrative": "Hi Kathleen,  Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  NPI reviewed Intuit?s LivePerson agreement last year ? as it turns out, this was a post-mortem and the deal had already been completed.  I?ve attached the review we did last year, and our feedback is similar this year.  From what NPI has seen on somewhat smaller LivePerson deals, this pricing is highly-negotiable.  We believe that the proposed $.80 per engagement for the 1.5M tier is at the very upper edge of Fair Market Value (FMV).   Last year, NPI recommended targeting $.60 per engagement for a deal of that size (2M+ engagements).  Considering the reduction in scope, as well as a partial, 9-month term, our recommended target for a this transaction would be between $.75 - $.81.  So we believe that the current pricing on the 1.5M tier is at the very upper edge of FMV with room for improvement.  Customer Success, however, is well over-priced on a deal of this size.  We typically see CSO offered at 25% - 30% of the platform cost.  LivePerson has left CSO at $37,600/month which totals 36% of the platform cost.  Intuit will want to push hard to get the CSO costs down closer to $300K/yr (25% of platform cost).",

At that time, we had not seen many Hearsay proposals and we did not have a SME in our Advisor Network who could help us with a review.  Over the past year, we have seen a number of Hearsay purchases and renewals and we have onboarded an Advisor (recent, former Hearsay salesperson) who is able to give us additional help in reviewing these transactions.    NPI?s FMV assessment is attached.  High-level: current agreement pricing is solid ? if COUNTRY is able to make a multi-year commitment then there may be savings available on this proposal.",

NPI reviewed Intuit?s LivePerson agreement last year ? as it turns out, this was a post-mortem and the deal had already been completed.  I?ve attached the review we did last year, and our feedback is similar this year.  From what NPI has seen on somewhat smaller LivePerson deals, this pricing is highly-negotiable.  We believe that the proposed $.80 per engagement for the 1.5M tier is at the very upper edge of Fair Market Value (FMV).   Last year, NPI recommended targeting $.60 per engagement for a deal of that size (2M+ engagements).  Considering the reduction in scope, as well as a partial, 9-month term, our recommended target for a this transaction would be between $.75 - $.81.  So we believe that the current pricing on the 1.5M tier is at the very upper edge of FMV with room for improvement.  Customer Success, however, is well over-priced on a deal of this size.  We typically see CSO offered at 25% - 30% of the platform cost.  LivePerson has left CSO at $37,600/month which totals 36% of the platform cost.  Intuit will want to push hard to get the CSO costs down closer to $300K/yr (25% of platform cost).",

We signed the current agreement 4 years ago with a much smaller strategic importance to Pacific Life.  Over the next 3-5 years AWS will become one of the most critical vendors to our operational success and we want to be sure we have a solid contract in place.",

In fact I have not even told Hortonworks (HW) that they have won the bid on our project.  The pricing is from the Account Rep at HW.    The F (Chirs) column is current quoting .  The G (Sam) column was a special pricing last year only because we bundled it with a Renewal which had an overall discount of 27% actually.  Chris states he cannot give the 50% because that was a bundle with a renewal and the best his CFO will allow is 35% off list.   Technically Hortonworks only allows upfront payments and 32 month terms to get the 35% discount.  2 year is 25% and 1 year is 15%.   We are aware of HW financial risk and have been watching them so we are not keen on paying up front and are in process of amending their contract with this purchase to pay annually/quarterly/monthly but not all 32 months up front.   They may not grant the 35% if I tell them that, but I am waiting to drop all of my demands on them at once- still waiting for the contract amendment to be complete by our legal.  I am also leveraging another vendor called Softpath, but have not talked to them yet.     Do you have any other customers who use Hortonworks?  Thanks, Elena",

        "current_narrative": "Hi Roy, Smita is OOO until Friday so I went through her recent effort to try and provide some feedback on this add-on subscription.  I can definitely confirm the SKU consolidation noted by Oracle. They have a document called their Fusion Cloud Service Descriptions document and the latest one clearly indicates the merging that you describe.  I?m assuming this is in addition to the review that Smita just provided. Let?s encapsulate that one: ?\t$5.2M in list costs over five years or $1,036,000 a year ?\t$2.5M in net costs over five years or $500K a year ?\t52% discount on each line item ?\t61% targeted discount suggested by NPI ?\tB67272 is the SKU that absorbed B67270.  These had respective list prices of $40 and $5 per month in 2015 and now that they?re combined the new list is still $40 for 67272.  Equifax got a 38% discount in 2015 and the current offer that we reviewed was at 52%.  The volume went up considerably from 300 to 1950 and the term lengthened from 3 years to 5 years. ?\tThere were two other products that comprised only 10% of the quote and had the same 52% discount and 61% target.  The renewal summarizes as follows: ?\t$1.2M in list costs over five years or $240K a year ?\t$674,655 in net costs over five years or ~$135K a year ?\tB75289 used to list for $400.  It now includes B69716 which listed for $50.  Together they increased the new B75289 to a sizable $650/mo which is 44% more than the combined $400+$50.  NPI hasn?t done a comparison of the capabilities of the software before and after but we certainly hope Oracle can articulate the reason behind the sizable increase. o\tOffered at $346.77 per month that?s a 46.7% discount.  This is less than the 52% offer on the other part of this renewal NPI recently reviewed.  In addition, compared to the combined total of the prior list prices of $450 it is a paltry 23% discount.  Of course, Oracle can highlight you only got a 25% discount in 2015 and now you?re at 46.7% (of course they raised prices 44%!) o\tNPI can see that the final outcomes in 2015 of $299 and $37 total $336 for these two SKUs and the $347.77 is 3% more than this.  Numbers can really get your head spinning of course.  A 3% increase seems reasonable in the Oracle ecosphere. o\tMore important to NPI the fact that Equifax is signing up for 5 years not 3 and expanding your extended list subscription costs from $1,071,000 over three years to about $6.5M over five years.  That?s a HUGE increase. This is enough of a change to get this repriced vs. accepting a 3% increase.  (Caveat: NPI is assuming the review from several weeks ago is in addition to this subscription) ?\tB69730 used to list for $150 and B69731 listed for $50.  You?d expect the newly-reconstituted B69730 to have increased in price but it is still at $150. o\tThe $103 offer is a 31% discount.  The quote 2 weeks ago had each line item the same. That is often the case with Oracle Fusion quotes but this quote has one at 46.7% and one at 31%. o\tNPI can see that total net price was $100 in 2015 and $103 is a 3% increase.  These were discounted 50% in 2015.  This one dropped from 50% to 31%. A bit unusual for Oracle. o\tThe blended discount is 44%.   Assuming, this is in addition to the prior review NPI sees no reason to not repeat our 61% discount target across the board.  The term and list spend has increases a lot and Equifax is a huge Oracle client.  You deserve top tier pricing. This does represent a sizable $200K cost reduction which is tough to get from Oracle on a renewal that is mid quarter and can only be attained by leveraging the other renewal?s growth. Standalone a blended 44% could be considered FMV with a blended target of 50%.",

This is a below the minimum dollar threshold for deals that NPI will typically review for Intuit (threshold is $100K).  However, I have a bit of Preemptive data and I did a quick analysis of this quote.  First, any type of unlimited license is very difficult to benchmark without expected usage rates.  Based on the comparative data that NPI has, $9K for an unlimited license appears to be within Fair Market Value (FMV); however, the true FMV for this will depend on how many users actually use the system.  The 12 Dotfuscator build licenses are pro-rated for 12-month (and longer) terms.  By NPI?s math, each build license has an annual cost of around $1.2K, and they are prorated out for the extended term.  Overall, this is within FMV.  NPI has seen Dotfuscator licenses offered slightly lower on larger deals, but we would consider this to be FMV.  Overall, for a deal of this size, NPI considers this pricing to be within FMV and Intuit can move forward.",

While license costs for Infor and Kronos are comparable, the implementation from Infor's partner Axsium is more than 5x WFCs for the Kronos solution.  Other scoped implementations have fallen in a middle range of the extremes.  5/16 Received the final Subscription.  We will bill for that and wait on services.  They are looking at other PS firms to validate Axsium scope before committing.   Gregg asked KT about discounts and this is the reply that was worth capturing: We weren?t able to determine the discount, but we also haven?t received final docs or any formal Infor quote yet.  While it?s not a discount, we did see them drop pricing from $307k per year to an anticipated $265k (still waiting on the exact final number for the subscription portion, but this was communicated verbally to Zumiez as the projected price).  That?d imply an additional discount of 14%.    The implementer also discounted labor rates from $175 -> $155, an 11% drop.  Not exactly discounts but that?s what we have so far.",
        "customer_comments": "The wide gap in implementation costs could mean Infor knows they are preferred and are trying to inflate costs.

The information below did not lend itself to a more formal FMV report, but if you need a formal document, I can create one for you.  It appears this maintenance renewal is priced within Fair Market Value (FMV).    Quest software maintenance is typically priced at ~15% of the software license cost.  Based on NPI?s knowledge of the VRanger product, it appears that this renewal is priced at ~17%, so this is in the range of FMV.    If COUNTRY wanted to push a bit, you could request that this pricing get below $12.5K in order to meet operating budget numbers.  Based on the size of this deal, there may not be much leverage.  COUNTRY could point to potential growth in the future and express that the current pricing may stifle growth of the VRanger solution.",

        "current_narrative": "Hi Roy, Smita is OOO until Friday so I went through her recent effort to try and provide some feedback on this add-on subscription.  I can definitely confirm the SKU consolidation noted by Oracle. They have a document called their Fusion Cloud Service Descriptions document and the latest one clearly indicates the merging that you describe.  I?m assuming this is in addition to the review that Smita just provided. Let?s encapsulate that one: ?\t$5.2M in list costs over five years or $1,036,000 a year ?\t$2.5M in net costs over five years or $500K a year ?\t52% discount on each line item ?\t61% targeted discount suggested by NPI ?\tB67272 is the SKU that absorbed B67270.  These had respective list prices of $40 and $5 per month in 2015 and now that they?re combined the new list is still $40 for 67272.  Equifax got a 38% discount in 2015 and the current offer that we reviewed was at 52%.  The volume went up considerably from 300 to 1950 and the term lengthened from 3 years to 5 years. ?\tThere were two other products that comprised only 10% of the quote and had the same 52% discount and 61% target.  The renewal summarizes as follows: ?\t$1.2M in list costs over five years or $240K a year ?\t$674,655 in net costs over five years or ~$135K a year ?\tB75289 used to list for $400.  It now includes B69716 which listed for $50.  Together they increased the new B75289 to a sizable $650/mo which is 44% more than the combined $400+$50.  NPI hasn?t done a comparison of the capabilities of the software before and after but we certainly hope Oracle can articulate the reason behind the sizable increase. o\tOffered at $346.77 per month that?s a 46.7% discount.  This is less than the 52% offer on the other part of this renewal NPI recently reviewed.  In addition, compared to the combined total of the prior list prices of $450 it is a paltry 23% discount.  Of course, Oracle can highlight you only got a 25% discount in 2015 and now you?re at 46.7% (of course they raised prices 44%!) o\tNPI can see that the final outcomes in 2015 of $299 and $37 total $336 for these two SKUs and the $347.77 is 3% more than this.  Numbers can really get your head spinning of course.  A 3% increase seems reasonable in the Oracle ecosphere. o\tMore important to NPI the fact that Equifax is signing up for 5 years not 3 and expanding your extended list subscription costs from $1,071,000 over three years to about $6.5M over five years.  That?s a HUGE increase. This is enough of a change to get this repriced vs. accepting a 3% increase.  (Caveat: NPI is assuming the review from several weeks ago is in addition to this subscription) ?\tB69730 used to list for $150 and B69731 listed for $50.  You?d expect the newly-reconstituted B69730 to have increased in price but it is still at $150. o\tThe $103 offer is a 31% discount.  The quote 2 weeks ago had each line item the same. That is often the case with Oracle Fusion quotes but this quote has one at 46.7% and one at 31%. o\tNPI can see that total net price was $100 in 2015 and $103 is a 3% increase.  These were discounted 50% in 2015.  This one dropped from 50% to 31%. A bit unusual for Oracle. o\tThe blended discount is 44%.   Assuming, this is in addition to the prior review NPI sees no reason to not repeat our 61% discount target across the board.  The term and list spend has increases a lot and Equifax is a huge Oracle client.  You deserve top tier pricing. This does represent a sizable $200K cost reduction which is tough to get from Oracle on a renewal that is mid quarter and can only be attained by leveraging the other renewal?s growth. Standalone a blended 44% could be considered FMV with a blended target of 50%.",

If they go up they charge you more.  If they go up they charge you more, If they go down they won't reduce your annual number.  They audit you or charge you the annual increase, etc. to get back to that number.  Protect against that now before you sign the contract.

You will want to ensure you have a solid understanding of what your implementation costs will be, as that will provide negotiation leverage in your discussions with Coupa. ?\tCoupa will ask you to talk to their references which is an attempt to divert from reducing their fees. ?\tIf Basware / Verian is a viable option (NOTE: it does not have to be a perfect solution, just as long as Coupa believes they are a real threat), CHOP can indicate that preliminary pricing looks VERY good from Verian. ?\tAsk for List pricing to be frozen for the term of the agreement and to agree on a discount % for that time.  Preferably at the same level ?\tPush to include 10k worth of incremental storage as a one-time concession to be used during the term of the agreement.  ?\tRequest to remove the 2% late penalty fee. ?\tNPI recommends that CHOP negotiate to get the total cost of the solution down to $800,000 and not try to discuss individual discounts.  CHOP can let Coupa know that budgets are tight and Coupa needs to get much more aggressive in order to get this project approved and moving this month which is the end of Coupa?s Q3.  Without these concessions, there could be a significant delay or CHOP my look further at alternatives. ?\tNegotiate SLAs similar to that of Workday ?\tCoupa's CEO is a marketing guy so be prepared to offer marketing rights, videos, references, etc., in exchange for concessions.  The more CHOP will agree to, the more concessions you will get. ?\tNPI recommends that CHOP ask for licensing protection language in their agreement to cover feature(s) shifting from one module to another.  Coupa is known to take features out of a module you have license rights to and shift or move it to another module that you don?t have license rights to.  Then trying to charge you an incremental fee.    Also recommended getting the Analytics thrown in at no additional cost.",

        "current_narrative": "Hi Roy, Smita is OOO until Friday so I went through her recent effort to try and provide some feedback on this add-on subscription.  I can definitely confirm the SKU consolidation noted by Oracle. They have a document called their Fusion Cloud Service Descriptions document and the latest one clearly indicates the merging that you describe.  I?m assuming this is in addition to the review that Smita just provided. Let?s encapsulate that one: ?\t$5.2M in list costs over five years or $1,036,000 a year ?\t$2.5M in net costs over five years or $500K a year ?\t52% discount on each line item ?\t61% targeted discount suggested by NPI ?\tB67272 is the SKU that absorbed B67270.  These had respective list prices of $40 and $5 per month in 2015 and now that they?re combined the new list is still $40 for 67272.  Equifax got a 38% discount in 2015 and the current offer that we reviewed was at 52%.  The volume went up considerably from 300 to 1950 and the term lengthened from 3 years to 5 years. ?\tThere were two other products that comprised only 10% of the quote and had the same 52% discount and 61% target.  The renewal summarizes as follows: ?\t$1.2M in list costs over five years or $240K a year ?\t$674,655 in net costs over five years or ~$135K a year ?\tB75289 used to list for $400.  It now includes B69716 which listed for $50.  Together they increased the new B75289 to a sizable $650/mo which is 44% more than the combined $400+$50.  NPI hasn?t done a comparison of the capabilities of the software before and after but we certainly hope Oracle can articulate the reason behind the sizable increase. o\tOffered at $346.77 per month that?s a 46.7% discount.  This is less than the 52% offer on the other part of this renewal NPI recently reviewed.  In addition, compared to the combined total of the prior list prices of $450 it is a paltry 23% discount.  Of course, Oracle can highlight you only got a 25% discount in 2015 and now you?re at 46.7% (of course they raised prices 44%!) o\tNPI can see that the final outcomes in 2015 of $299 and $37 total $336 for these two SKUs and the $347.77 is 3% more than this.  Numbers can really get your head spinning of course.  A 3% increase seems reasonable in the Oracle ecosphere. o\tMore important to NPI the fact that Equifax is signing up for 5 years not 3 and expanding your extended list subscription costs from $1,071,000 over three years to about $6.5M over five years.  That?s a HUGE increase. This is enough of a change to get this repriced vs. accepting a 3% increase.  (Caveat: NPI is assuming the review from several weeks ago is in addition to this subscription) ?\tB69730 used to list for $150 and B69731 listed for $50.  You?d expect the newly-reconstituted B69730 to have increased in price but it is still at $150. o\tThe $103 offer is a 31% discount.  The quote 2 weeks ago had each line item the same. That is often the case with Oracle Fusion quotes but this quote has one at 46.7% and one at 31%. o\tNPI can see that total net price was $100 in 2015 and $103 is a 3% increase.  These were discounted 50% in 2015.  This one dropped from 50% to 31%. A bit unusual for Oracle. o\tThe blended discount is 44%.   Assuming, this is in addition to the prior review NPI sees no reason to not repeat our 61% discount target across the board.  The term and list spend has increases a lot and Equifax is a huge Oracle client.  You deserve top tier pricing. This does represent a sizable $200K cost reduction which is tough to get from Oracle on a renewal that is mid quarter and can only be attained by leveraging the other renewal?s growth. Standalone a blended 44% could be considered FMV with a blended target of 50%.",

        "current_narrative": "Tableau, unlike many other vendors, tends to sell their products at list price without offering large discounts.  With organizations that have large footprints, NPI has seen discounts range from 7% - 25% (depending heavily on the size of the footprint).    One of Tableau?s co-founders is also a co-founder of Pixar (and a Stanford professor), and he is a big reason for Tableau?s push for outstanding visualizations and intuitiveness. Tableau invests heavily in R&D and support, which adds to their reasoning against discounting.  Although NPI has seen only a single example where Tableau offered discounts of 25% on a new purchase, we have been recently seeing deeper and more frequent discounts being offered.  It is NPI?s belief that although they remain the leader in the Gartner quadrant, Microsoft?s Power BI may be starting to slowly gain ground and thereby forcing Tableau to be a little more generous in discounting.

If the validation of the 51 seats requires a 52nd seat, the term license should be renewed.  If there are unused perpetual licenses, the term license should be cancelled and the user should be migrated to a perpetual seat.  NPI acknowledges that although the dollar amount may be insignificant, NPI?s goal is to always recommend best practices to avoid waste and maximize profitability. ?\tNPI recommends that CSAA request that support timeframes be added to the current proposal for documentation purposes and clarity on exact support end dates. ?\tNPI recommends that CSAA can confidently proceed with the support renewal after a quick validation of perpetual license users.",

        "current_narrative": "ADDING PRICE LIST THAT SME SHARED DEC 2017.  We iterated in mid Nov.  Worked with Sme again and might've found list pricing. NEver got a quote from MS.  See attached email with her follow on request and my feedback.   No quote and asked a number of clarifying questions.  Ended up sharing feedback before hearing back. Some assumptions were not correct.  See attached email with questions and feedback.  Hi Lara, I hadn?t heard back about some of my initial questions but I made some progress on our review that I thought would be helpful as you progress.  Our feedback lent itself to bullets. ?\tIt is not crystal clear but it appears the current $153K run rate is being co-termed to the start of this upgrade for a term of 3 months.  That equates to $38,250 ($153,000 / 4).  I?m not clear on really what the upgrade means vis-\u00e0-vis what you own. The metric in your original MSA was CPU and the product was Alfresco Enterprise Network not Enterprise One.  I?m assuming you?re really just buy the new platform at renewal time. ?\tOver the past year they?ve basically just rebranded Alfresco One Enterprise to be replaced by Digital Business Platform which appears to be a simple rebranding, not a capability upgrade. ?\tThey have two masthead customers ? Cisco and Nike.   o\tCisco uses it for their salesforce.  People had created content on personal drives and team drives and they estimated they were losing 100K+ hours in productivity a year.  Alfresco doesn?t force you to rethink where you store stuff.  It crawls the network, puts documents in its own storage system and indexes it all for you (NOTE: there will be plenty of Azure or AWS costs to support this storage.  Alfresco will facilitate this and provide a recommended architecture).  They bring your content to you is what they say.  If you want to add business processes  and design your own work flows in drag and drop fashion that?s their BPM Activiti offering. o\tNike does all their digital media storage in Alfresco. ?\tWhile the quote pasted below isn?t crystal clear this is how NPI views step 1 in the analysis (determine the list price)  o\t$38,250 - Existing footprint support co-termed to 8/31/17 o\t$125,000 ? Digital Platform.  NPI has a price list from just before the new rebranding happened.  No pricing is published on their website  - https://www.alfresco.com/platform/pricing.   This covers the first 1000 Named Users and Content Services, Governance Services and Process Services.  ?\tNPIs overarching feedback is to push Alfresco to share a quote with clearer pricing including pricing by product, showing the first 1000 and the add-ons to get to 2,500 Named Users.  They can and will provide this if pushed. ?\tEven though Process Services are included this is not the full blown BPM Activiti product.  It is a lite version ? as an analogy think Notepad functionality (what?s included) vs. Word (the separate offering)  o\t$187,500 ? additional 1,500 Named Users of the Platform.  List has been $12,500 per 100.  MS needs 15 more of these [(2,500 ? 1,000) / 100] o\t$60,000 ? ($20K x 3) - Indexing has been and remains a separate subscription. In the recent past the name was Index Server not Alfresco Index Engine.  Each Index Server costs $20K list and comes with 4 cores running on a single CPU.  ?\tThe base platform comes with rudimentary indexing (believe that?s the Governance piece which has basic Records Management) but this more robust version is typically needed. o\t$70,000 ? ($25,000 + $3K * 15) Content Encryption lists for $25,000 for up to 1,000 Named Users.  Additional Named Users are $3K per 100.  o\t$480,750 is NPIs List Price estimate.  There?s certainly a chance we?d want to amend this if we got further clarity on our prior questions and learned of any list price changes that came with the recent rebranding but if the prices went up I?d push hard to find out what?s different from the prior Alfresco One product that listed for $125K a year.  ?\tMorgan Stanley?s offer of $422,375 does not reflect an acceptable discount at just over 12%.  My advisor sold for Alfresco as recently as a year ago and indicated AEs had a fair amount of leeway. He?d often lead with a 60-65% discount.  Of course, we?d want to validate NPIs list price estimate but this should start to set Morgan Stanely?s expectations that 60%+ is attainable. ?\tThere are few seven figure deals within Alfresco so this is a sizable opportunity for them.  Morgan Stanley would likely become a top 5-10% customer. ?\tAnecdotally NPI has heard a VC is looking at buying Alfresco. That can be good or bad of course but it does reflect uncertainty that may lend itself to a negotiation nugget. ?\tIf you do a multi-year deal expect 3-5% increases being offered.  Their sales team loves multi-year deals as they get paid upfront on those which is not the case with many software companies. ?\tSome competitors in this space are noted below. Morgan Stanley is a HUGE Adobe customer so that could be a leverage point.  o\tSharepoint is #1 o\tFileNet (IBM) o\tDocumentum (EMC) o\tAppian o\tExterro o\tNuxeo o\tAdobe Experience Manager   Please share updates as you get them or answers to prior questions when you get a chance to review. Thanks   SUMMARY OUTCOME (NO DOCS):  Hi Gregg,    For Alfresco the best we could agree was the $396k for 2,500 users for a 1 year subscription plus a 10% flex allowance getting us to the true number of 2,750 users for the $396k fee. This unit cost is now at $158.74 but we have agreed a tiered discount for future purchases where the unit cost will go down gradually. If we reach the 9,500-10,000 user level, the unit cost goes down to $98.25 per user per year.    I hope that helps and I apologize for the delay!",
        "customer_comments": "not crystal clear what comprises the final outcome.  Is it just the platform that lists for $232.5K for 1000 users plus 209K for 1000 more and then 5x 23.3K to get to 2500 users?  Later, 2020, doing an Amfam review I saw their users were concurrent.  One table Lara shared at end wasn't crystal clear but appeared to be named user. I asked her to clarify. her reply:They are for individual users, definitely not concurrent.",

        "current_narrative": "Worked with Graham on pricing targets and strategies. ?\tCurrent discounting is at the low end of FMV ?\tCoupa can provide more aggressive discounting if they feel they need to in order to win the business.  Details are in the table below. ?\tThere is no real overhead associated with setting up the Test Sandbox, so Coupa can provide this at no or minimal cost. ?\tNPI recommends that CHOP not allow Coupa to bind your license fees to the license metrics provided.  If they go up they charge you more.  If they go up they charge you more, If they go down they won't reduce your annual number.  They audit you or charge you the annual increase, etc. to get back to that number.  Protect against that now before you sign the contract.   After saying NO multiple times Coupa finally came down to 890K and threw in Analytics.when it got closer to the end of the quarter",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI recommends that CHOP begin the negotiations with KPMG or other implementation provider.  CHOP should have a serious conversation about the true cost to enable the expected number of vendors in the Coupa system.  You will want to ensure you have a solid understanding of what your implementation costs will be, as that will provide negotiation leverage in your discussions with Coupa. ?\tCoupa will ask you to talk to their references which is an attempt to divert from reducing their fees. ?\tIf Basware / Verian is a viable option (NOTE: it does not have to be a perfect solution, just as long as Coupa believes they are a real threat), CHOP can indicate that preliminary pricing looks VERY good from Verian. ?\tAsk for List pricing to be frozen for the term of the agreement and to agree on a discount % for that time.  Preferably at the same level ?\tPush to include 10k worth of incremental storage as a one-time concession to be used during the term of the agreement.  ?\tRequest to remove the 2% late penalty fee. ?\tNPI recommends that CHOP negotiate to get the total cost of the solution down to $800,000 and not try to discuss individual discounts.  CHOP can let Coupa know that budgets are tight and Coupa needs to get much more aggressive in order to get this project approved and moving this month which is the end of Coupa?s Q3.  Without these concessions, there could be a significant delay or CHOP my look further at alternatives. ?\tNegotiate SLAs similar to that of Workday ?\tCoupa's CEO is a marketing guy so be prepared to offer marketing rights, videos, references, etc., in exchange for concessions.  The more CHOP will agree to, the more concessions you will get. ?\tNPI recommends that CHOP ask for licensing protection language in their agreement to cover feature(s) shifting from one module to another.  Coupa is known to take features out of a module you have license rights to and shift or move it to another module that you don?t have license rights to.  Then trying to charge you an incremental fee.    Also recommended getting the Analytics thrown in at no additional cost.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI had reviewed this subscription for a client pre-acquisition.  At that time it was priced around $1.25 per employee and they offered up discounts in the 15-25% range.  BJCs offer works out to $4.00 for the two subscriptions or $3.33 for the main PolicyTech one.  That?s a sizable 2-3X price increase over the past couple years.  It is not clear if this reflects a discount as they don?t publish a price list but it feels like list and even looks like list.  This is a good-sized deal for Navex.  The quote doesn?t talk much about future year pricing and historically they haven?t raised prices much but that may not be true anymore.  Push for clarity and for flat renewal pricing.  While the new pricing may be the new reality it may behoove BJC to be ready to indicate through your own research and other employees seeing this at other firms have seen PolicyTech closer to $1.25 per employee and while you know this is a better solution post-acquisition the increase seems too steep.  This is where you?d also share a number that you are willing to pay based on Compliance360 historical pricing and budget.  NPIs target is $75K for this main subscription and $10-15K for the Workflow module.  Paying $85K for these is fair and reflects a $35K reduction per year.  NPI has previously seen the PolicyTech setup shown with a list of $3K and discounted to $2500.  Interesting you?re offer looks like it lists for $2500.  They have historically discounted this about 15% so why not target that.  They may counter that the Workflow setup fee is at no charge.  I?d counter that you?re used to their being minimal set up fees when you?re buying six figures of a SaaS subscription.   Continuing along this line, Navex has been known to nickel and dime customers as evidenced also by the User Import and Gateway Assistance items. These are cheap at a total of $2K.  We?ve seen Gateway fees waived and the Import fee discounted 50%.  Achieving these targets saves about $1500 a year.  The Quickstart feels expensive at $25K.  My SME suggested you push for a sizable reduction to $12,500.  This is to help you fine tune and be able to self-manage.  Reading the description, it doesn?t feel like a $25K effort. You are signing up for 3 years after all and many providers deeply discount the one-time fees when you do a multi-year SaaS contract.  A challenge could be that they see services as a low margin business that hits a separate P&L within Navex which can present challenges when you push for sizable discounts.  Achieving a $5-10K reduction would be a nice outcome.  On the SLA front they?ve gotten stingier.  We?ve seen 25 second for average speed to answer with an 80% goal which speaks to the first and third items above which had worse targets.  Have seen abandon rate due to wait time of longer than 25 seconds targeting 96% or more.  You?ve got 30 seconds and the target is 95%+.  Availability has improved from 99% to 99.5%.     Note from another client on their outcome sent to BJC:  We got the vendor to increase our employee count to 18,000 at the same cost and reduce some of the Initial Fees.  Also, locked in costs for additional employees at the same rate as the initial purchase.",

        "current_narrative": "Tableau, unlike many other vendors, tends to sell their products at list price without offering large discounts.  With organizations that have large footprints, NPI has seen discounts range from 7% - 25% (depending heavily on the size of the footprint).    One of Tableau?s co-founders is also a co-founder of Pixar (and a Stanford professor), and he is a big reason for Tableau?s push for outstanding visualizations and intuitiveness. Tableau invests heavily in R&D and support, which adds to their reasoning against discounting.  Although NPI has seen only a single example where Tableau offered discounts of 25% on a new purchase, we have been recently seeing deeper and more frequent discounts being offered.  It is NPI?s belief that although they remain the leader in the Gartner quadrant, Microsoft?s Power BI may be starting to slowly gain ground and thereby forcing Tableau to be a little more generous in discounting.

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed Illumio?s proposal to BNYM and found pricing to be within fair market value (FMV), but with some important caveats.  NPI believes BNYM?s potential spend with the vendor represents one of their top accounts, and certainly the most important in the region.  Illumio?s needs this deal immensely, as NPI is aware of several recent implementations in large financial service institutions that have gone awry.  NPI does caution that one of the major issues with these other implementations is around deployment concerns in which several comparable spends saw less than 50% of committed licenses in use by the end of the term, along with a few with usage below 25%.  NPI suggests checking usage of the existing and proposed deployments, as we do see this as a recurring issue.   NPI views the base pricing in this deal to be towards the top of the range in terms of the vendor?s discounting, but BNYM has a significant amount of leverage in this spend due to its importance to Illumio.  Alignment with the vendor?s fiscal quarter end in April further improves BNYM?s position, and any credible doubt that Illumio can create suggesting this transaction could lag into May due to cost pressures will help your position immensely.  NPI cannot emphasize enough how strategic the success of BNYM?s relationship is to Illumio?s wider organization.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI recommends BNYM first confirm your internal usage forecasts and to push Illumio to apply the 74% discount base to the lowest purchase tier.  BNYM should phrase any messaging around these requests as ?necessary to stay within cost parameters and maintain an April timeframe for the deal.? ?\tNPI highly recommends not mentioning any specific discounts or information provided by any benchmarking activities, and to instead focus Illumio on a $4.65M price target that maintains a  o\tNPI suggests confirming usage first, and to focus messaging on a high-level TCO figure that may be even lower than the $4.65M target applied to this full proposal.   ?\tBNYM should feel confident in considering more aggressive discounts if a purchase above 25k new licenses is determined to be within demand forecasts.  While these are the FMV targets in line with what NPI observes in comparable deals, BNYM is in custom territory due to the importance of this deal to the vendor.",

        "current_narrative": "Worked with Graham on pricing targets and strategies. ?\tCurrent discounting is at the low end of FMV ?\tCoupa can provide more aggressive discounting if they feel they need to in order to win the business.  Details are in the table below. ?\tThere is no real overhead associated with setting up the Test Sandbox, so Coupa can provide this at no or minimal cost. ?\tNPI recommends that CHOP not allow Coupa to bind your license fees to the license metrics provided.  If they go up they charge you more.  If they go up they charge you more, If they go down they won't reduce your annual number.  They audit you or charge you the annual increase, etc. to get back to that number.  Protect against that now before you sign the contract.   After saying NO multiple times Coupa finally came down to 890K and threw in Analytics.when it got closer to the end of the quarter",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI recommends that CHOP begin the negotiations with KPMG or other implementation provider.  CHOP should have a serious conversation about the true cost to enable the expected number of vendors in the Coupa system.  You will want to ensure you have a solid understanding of what your implementation costs will be, as that will provide negotiation leverage in your discussions with Coupa. ?\tCoupa will ask you to talk to their references which is an attempt to divert from reducing their fees. ?\tIf Basware / Verian is a viable option (NOTE: it does not have to be a perfect solution, just as long as Coupa believes they are a real threat), CHOP can indicate that preliminary pricing looks VERY good from Verian. ?\tAsk for List pricing to be frozen for the term of the agreement and to agree on a discount % for that time.  Preferably at the same level ?\tPush to include 10k worth of incremental storage as a one-time concession to be used during the term of the agreement.  ?\tRequest to remove the 2% late penalty fee. ?\tNPI recommends that CHOP negotiate to get the total cost of the solution down to $800,000 and not try to discuss individual discounts.  CHOP can let Coupa know that budgets are tight and Coupa needs to get much more aggressive in order to get this project approved and moving this month which is the end of Coupa?s Q3.  Without these concessions, there could be a significant delay or CHOP my look further at alternatives. ?\tNegotiate SLAs similar to that of Workday ?\tCoupa's CEO is a marketing guy so be prepared to offer marketing rights, videos, references, etc., in exchange for concessions.  The more CHOP will agree to, the more concessions you will get. ?\tNPI recommends that CHOP ask for licensing protection language in their agreement to cover feature(s) shifting from one module to another.  Coupa is known to take features out of a module you have license rights to and shift or move it to another module that you don?t have license rights to.  Then trying to charge you an incremental fee.    Also recommended getting the Analytics thrown in at no additional cost.",

Review final pricing to ensure that support lands at 20% of the final hardware and software costs.    Negotiation Leverage and Strategy ?\tIn contrast to the prior negotiation tactics with Ivoxy, NPI recommends that rather than focusing on dollar amounts, SCH should work with Ivoxy and push them for the same discounts as previously received.  Because SCH now has a target discount to strive for, it sets a somewhat innocent target that needs to be met.   ?\tNPI would expect a pushback based on the prior deal was ~ 1 million greater in list pricing.  Reality is that after discounts are applied, the differences are within a few hundred thousand and still warrant discount levels greater than the current 64% on hardware and software. ?\t?New logo? opportunities help drive discounting a little deeper.  This deeper discounting may have occurred in the prior deal.  The position that SCH should maintain is that ?we can still easily choose to play a dual vendor strategy with our storage solutions if we can?t find the right solution at the right price?. ?\tSupport is currently quoted at 23% of the combined hardware and software costs.  NPI recommends that SCH target a 20% of net price of hardware and software. ?\tNetApp Q3 end is 10/31 and a quarter-end deal will typically allow for the best negotiation power with a promise to close this deal in Q3.",

        "current_narrative": "Amfam facing ?forced? upgrade from SA (SA retired, no longer available to renew as of July 1, 2017) to SWM.  Past discount was well above FMV at 58%. New offer is SWM at 45%.  Seeing big increase due to Citrix ?packaging? additional features/services into a new support model ?> no longer a-la-carte. ?\tPreviously -- Software updates and support were purchased separately ?\tNew model ? Advertised as ?Customer Support Services?; combines software updates and support, while also expanding and creating a new baseline support tier system o\t3 Tier structure created ? 1. Select, 2. Priority, 3. Priority Plus ?\tPriority Plus appears to have advantages similar to a TRM ?\tRecommend to negotiate price based on an increase due to packaging support features not previously purchased inflating the new baseline price.   No change observed for TRM engagement ? pricing consistent ?\tHowever, the Priority Plus tier may become a reasonable alternative  Closed - FINAL RESULT; feedback from Citrix below....also confirmed no concessions on TRM - holding true to what we typically see...  Thank you for taking the time to express American Family?s concerns with Citrix Maintenance pricing as well as the requirement to have an active agreement in place. We value your business and have voiced your concerns internally to see what can be done to help your organization transition to our new Customer Success Services offering.\u00a0 \u00a0 Renewal Pricing:  \u00a0 As you?re aware, American Family has not made a qualifying purchase to maintain their ELA-6 discount causing contractual pricing to reduce to the ELA-2 discount of 25%. However, given the relationship with American Family and the change in our program, the Citrix team acted in good faith by agreeing to honor the 45% discount on the initial renewal quote.  The additional good news is that we raised your current concerns internally and have secured a concession to temporarily increase American Family?s renewal discount to 53% if a renewal is transacted on-time by 12/27/17.   *Note: This concession is granted for this transaction only and will not permanently change American Family?s maintenance price on future renewals. While you didn?t express an interest in a multiyear commitment, this concession CAN also be utilized if an upfront payment is made. Considering the savings, it may be something to consider.  \u00a0 Summary: \u00a0 We have attached a full quote that includes both Software and Hardware at the concession price. While we understand that all of your requests were not fulfilled, \u00a0this is the best and final that Citrix can offer. We also feel confident that American Family will see the value of our new Customer Success Services offering after you have had a chance to utilize the many new features. I am available to work with you on whatever option you decide so please reach out after you have had a chance to review internally.",
        "customer_comments": "Good improvement.  \u00a0 Xen Desktop Platinum:\u00a0 NPI recommended 50% would be good, shoot for 55% to settle in the middle  Citrix came back at 53% - with a rate of $35.25 >>> rounding discount up from fractional percent, actual @$300k is closer to $35.29  Negligible, about $300 difference for a $300,000 line item Citrix NetScaler SDX 11500 Appliance ? This was not included in the original quote NPI did not provide a recommendation  Quick research, renewing at the previous rate that AmFam received ($8,910 Gold, $4,950 Bronze) ? no change.\u00a0 Remains at past discount of 45% Additional hardware maintenance not provided to NPI for review includes:  Citrix NetScaler SDX 11515 Appliance ? Gold $7,567.40 Citrix NetScaler MPX 8200 Platinum Edition ? Gold $3,917.96 SW and HW TRM ? provided feedback that it is rare to see movement, have seen AmFam receive a one off 10% discount in the past  Citrix renewal is at list  Additional feedback in response could include:  For a purchase of this size any reference to ELA-2 is a bit disingenuous as NPI does not typically see a major enterprise the size of AmFam come in at 25% on a maintenance renewal. In the past we?d expect 25% off Subscription Advantage but this is for an upgraded level of support so that doesn?t apply anymore in our opinion..\u00a0 The movement from a 45% discount to a 53% is a good deal ? if executed then congratulations this is a savings of $53,515. In preparing for your next renewal (2019), track the conversation and progress regarding movement to Customer Success Services during 2018 ? any history that you can maintain and capture regarding any pain points with this migration will be beneficial to bring up during your next renewal cycle.",

        "current_narrative": "Tableau, unlike many other vendors, tends to sell their products at list price without offering large discounts.  With organizations that have large footprints, NPI has seen discounts range from 7% - 25% (depending heavily on the size of the footprint).    One of Tableau?s co-founders is also a co-founder of Pixar (and a Stanford professor), and he is a big reason for Tableau?s push for outstanding visualizations and intuitiveness. Tableau invests heavily in R&D and support, which adds to their reasoning against discounting.  Although NPI has seen only a single example where Tableau offered discounts of 25% on a new purchase, we have been recently seeing deeper and more frequent discounts being offered.  It is NPI?s belief that although they remain the leader in the Gartner quadrant, Microsoft?s Power BI may be starting to slowly gain ground and thereby forcing Tableau to be a little more generous in discounting.  Tableau maintenance fees are calculated as a flat 25% of the license price.

The proposal in the spreadsheet you sent over is rather inconsistent, which we do not typically see on Forcepoint deals.  Was this done through a reseller?  Overall, the pricing in this proposal is ABOVE Fair Market Value (FMV).  There should be significant savings available on this purchase.",

        "current_narrative": "Worked with Graham on pricing targets and strategies. ?\tCurrent discounting is at the low end of FMV ?\tCoupa can provide more aggressive discounting if they feel they need to in order to win the business.  Details are in the table below. ?\tThere is no real overhead associated with setting up the Test Sandbox, so Coupa can provide this at no or minimal cost. ?\tNPI recommends that CHOP not allow Coupa to bind your license fees to the license metrics provided.  If they go up they charge you more.  If they go up they charge you more, If they go down they won't reduce your annual number.  They audit you or charge you the annual increase, etc. to get back to that number.  Protect against that now before you sign the contract.   After saying NO multiple times Coupa finally came down to 890K and threw in Analytics.when it got closer to the end of the quarter",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI recommends that CHOP begin the negotiations with KPMG or other implementation provider.  CHOP should have a serious conversation about the true cost to enable the expected number of vendors in the Coupa system.  You will want to ensure you have a solid understanding of what your implementation costs will be, as that will provide negotiation leverage in your discussions with Coupa. ?\tCoupa will ask you to talk to their references which is an attempt to divert from reducing their fees. ?\tIf Basware / Verian is a viable option (NOTE: it does not have to be a perfect solution, just as long as Coupa believes they are a real threat), CHOP can indicate that preliminary pricing looks VERY good from Verian. ?\tAsk for List pricing to be frozen for the term of the agreement and to agree on a discount % for that time.  Preferably at the same level ?\tPush to include 10k worth of incremental storage as a one-time concession to be used during the term of the agreement.  ?\tRequest to remove the 2% late penalty fee. ?\tNPI recommends that CHOP negotiate to get the total cost of the solution down to $800,000 and not try to discuss individual discounts.  CHOP can let Coupa know that budgets are tight and Coupa needs to get much more aggressive in order to get this project approved and moving this month which is the end of Coupa?s Q3.  Without these concessions, there could be a significant delay or CHOP my look further at alternatives. ?\tNegotiate SLAs similar to that of Workday ?\tCoupa's CEO is a marketing guy so be prepared to offer marketing rights, videos, references, etc., in exchange for concessions.  The more CHOP will agree to, the more concessions you will get. ?\tNPI recommends that CHOP ask for licensing protection language in their agreement to cover feature(s) shifting from one module to another.  Coupa is known to take features out of a module you have license rights to and shift or move it to another module that you don?t have license rights to.  Then trying to charge you an incremental fee.    Also recommended getting the Analytics thrown in at no additional cost.",

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  We do have quite a bit of BMC data for comparison and considering your urgency, see our feedback below (in lieu of a more formal FMV report).  BMC has several flavors of its Control-M automation software.  We have a couple of BMC price lists, but without part numbers, we are unable to calculate a discount percentage.  We strongly recommend that you push back on BMC and ask for a revised quote that shows the list price for this purchase (preferably by line-item).  Here is what we think we know: ? The quote says that support is included for the first year.  We know that BMC support is almost always 20% of the net license purchase so the $148,500 likely breaks down this way:  o $123,750 for licensing o $24,750 for support  We have seen that BMC will get very aggressive with discounting.  On a recent $250K renewal (similar Control-M products), another NPI client saw 80% discounting.  In another deal where BMC won in a competitive take-out over CA, a similar sized deal was discounted at 88%.  So, once Trinity receives a list price quote for this purchase, you will want to ensure that you are seeing discounting in the 75% - 85% range.  Incidentally, the client who was moving away from CA and bought Control-M ? that effort is failing.  Our client is scrambling to crawl back to CA and extend the support on the product they were going to drop.  They are leaving a bunch of failed services spend with BMC in the dust and not going with Control M.  Trinity should mention to BMC that you have heard some stories from the industry about failed implementations ? use the FUD (Fear Uncertainty, & Doubt) to create more leverage.  NOTE: NPI is vendor agnostic, we do not recommend one product/vendor over another.  The above is shared only as a means to gain additional leverage in your negotiations with BMC.   UPDATE: Received add'l info from Belli on List price... sent Jim an update:  Hey Jim,   I wanted to follow-up with a bit more info that I?ve learned.  I was able to get some feedback from one of NPI?s mainframe experts and we believe that we may have figured out list pricing.  If we are correct, the Control-M Platform has a list price of $250/task.  Control-M Base ? Enterprise has a list price of $25K.  If we do the math, $250 * 500 + $25000 * 1 + 20% of licensing for support, the list price for your proposal is $180,000.  Which would mean that you are only receiving a 17.5% discount on this proposal.  NPI considers this pricing to be egregiously overpriced.  As I mentioned before, we have seen these types of purchases reach 75% - 85% discounting.  We recommend that you reach out to BMC and let them know that your market research shows you have meager discounting and this pricing is a non-starter.  This $148K quote should be closer to $50K.",

New offer is SWM at 45%.  Seeing big increase due to Citrix ?packaging? additional features/services into a new support model ?> no longer a-la-carte. ?\tPreviously -- Software updates and support were purchased separately ?\tNew model ? Advertised as ?Customer Support Services?; combines software updates and support, while also expanding and creating a new baseline support tier system o\t3 Tier structure created ? 1. Select, 2. Priority, 3. Priority Plus ?\tPriority Plus appears to have advantages similar to a TRM ?\tRecommend to negotiate price based on an increase due to packaging support features not previously purchased inflating the new baseline price.   No change observed for TRM engagement ? pricing consistent ?\tHowever, the Priority Plus tier may become a reasonable alternative  Closed - FINAL RESULT; feedback from Citrix below....also confirmed no concessions on TRM - holding true to what we typically see...  Thank you for taking the time to express American Family?s concerns with Citrix Maintenance pricing as well as the requirement to have an active agreement in place. We value your business and have voiced your concerns internally to see what can be done to help your organization transition to our new Customer Success Services offering.\u00a0 \u00a0 Renewal Pricing:  \u00a0 As you?re aware, American Family has not made a qualifying purchase to maintain their ELA-6 discount causing contractual pricing to reduce to the ELA-2 discount of 25%. However, given the relationship with American Family and the change in our program, the Citrix team acted in good faith by agreeing to honor the 45% discount on the initial renewal quote.  The additional good news is that we raised your current concerns internally and have secured a concession to temporarily increase American Family?s renewal discount to 53% if a renewal is transacted on-time by 12/27/17.   *Note: This concession is granted for this transaction only and will not permanently change American Family?s maintenance price on future renewals. While you didn?t express an interest in a multiyear commitment, this concession CAN also be utilized if an upfront payment is made. Considering the savings, it may be something to consider.  \u00a0 Summary: \u00a0 We have attached a full quote that includes both Software and Hardware at the concession price. While we understand that all of your requests were not fulfilled, \u00a0this is the best and final that Citrix can offer. We also feel confident that American Family will see the value of our new Customer Success Services offering after you have had a chance to utilize the many new features. I am available to work with you on whatever option you decide so please reach out after you have had a chance to review internally.",
        "customer_comments": "Good improvement.  \u00a0 Xen Desktop Platinum:\u00a0 NPI recommended 50% would be good, shoot for 55% to settle in the middle  Citrix came back at 53% - with a rate of $35.25 >>> rounding discount up from fractional percent, actual @$300k is closer to $35.29  Negligible, about $300 difference for a $300,000 line item Citrix NetScaler SDX 11500 Appliance ? This was not included in the original quote NPI did not provide a recommendation  Quick research, renewing at the previous rate that AmFam received ($8,910 Gold, $4,950 Bronze) ? no change.\u00a0 Remains at past discount of 45% Additional hardware maintenance not provided to NPI for review includes:  Citrix NetScaler SDX 11515 Appliance ? Gold $7,567.40 Citrix NetScaler MPX 8200 Platinum Edition ? Gold $3,917.96 SW and HW TRM ? provided feedback that it is rare to see movement, have seen AmFam receive a one off 10% discount in the past  Citrix renewal is at list  Additional feedback in response could include:  For a purchase of this size any reference to ELA-2 is a bit disingenuous as NPI does not typically see a major enterprise the size of AmFam come in at 25% on a maintenance renewal. In the past we?d expect 25% off Subscription Advantage but this is for an upgraded level of support so that doesn?t apply anymore in our opinion..\u00a0 The movement from a 45% discount to a 53% is a good deal ? if executed then congratulations this is a savings of $53,515. In preparing for your next renewal (2019), track the conversation and progress regarding movement to Customer Success Services during 2018 ? any history that you can maintain and capture regarding any pain points with this migration will be beneficial to bring up during your next renewal cycle.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed Illumio?s proposal to BNYM and found pricing to be within fair market value (FMV), but with some important caveats.  NPI believes BNYM?s potential spend with the vendor represents one of their top accounts, and certainly the most important in the region.  Illumio?s needs this deal immensely, as NPI is aware of several recent implementations in large financial service institutions that have gone awry.  NPI does caution that one of the major issues with these other implementations is around deployment concerns in which several comparable spends saw less than 50% of committed licenses in use by the end of the term, along with a few with usage below 25%.  NPI suggests checking usage of the existing and proposed deployments, as we do see this as a recurring issue.   NPI views the base pricing in this deal to be towards the top of the range in terms of the vendor?s discounting, but BNYM has a significant amount of leverage in this spend due to its importance to Illumio.  Alignment with the vendor?s fiscal quarter end in April further improves BNYM?s position, and any credible doubt that Illumio can create suggesting this transaction could lag into May due to cost pressures will help your position immensely.  NPI cannot emphasize enough how strategic the success of BNYM?s relationship is to Illumio?s wider organization.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI recommends BNYM first confirm your internal usage forecasts and to push Illumio to apply the 74% discount base to the lowest purchase tier.  BNYM should phrase any messaging around these requests as ?necessary to stay within cost parameters and maintain an April timeframe for the deal.? ?\tNPI highly recommends not mentioning any specific discounts or information provided by any benchmarking activities, and to instead focus Illumio on a $4.65M price target that maintains a  o\tNPI suggests confirming usage first, and to focus messaging on a high-level TCO figure that may be even lower than the $4.65M target applied to this full proposal.   ?\tBNYM should feel confident in considering more aggressive discounts if a purchase above 25k new licenses is determined to be within demand forecasts.  While these are the FMV targets in line with what NPI observes in comparable deals, BNYM is in custom territory due to the importance of this deal to the vendor.",

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  We do have quite a bit of BMC data for comparison and considering your urgency, see our feedback below (in lieu of a more formal FMV report).  BMC has several flavors of its Control-M automation software.  We have a couple of BMC price lists, but without part numbers, we are unable to calculate a discount percentage.  We strongly recommend that you push back on BMC and ask for a revised quote that shows the list price for this purchase (preferably by line-item).  Here is what we think we know: ? The quote says that support is included for the first year.  We know that BMC support is almost always 20% of the net license purchase so the $148,500 likely breaks down this way:  o $123,750 for licensing o $24,750 for support  We have seen that BMC will get very aggressive with discounting.  On a recent $250K renewal (similar Control-M products), another NPI client saw 80% discounting.  In another deal where BMC won in a competitive take-out over CA, a similar sized deal was discounted at 88%.  So, once Trinity receives a list price quote for this purchase, you will want to ensure that you are seeing discounting in the 75% - 85% range.  Incidentally, the client who was moving away from CA and bought Control-M ? that effort is failing.  Our client is scrambling to crawl back to CA and extend the support on the product they were going to drop.  They are leaving a bunch of failed services spend with BMC in the dust and not going with Control M.  Trinity should mention to BMC that you have heard some stories from the industry about failed implementations ? use the FUD (Fear Uncertainty, & Doubt) to create more leverage.  NOTE: NPI is vendor agnostic, we do not recommend one product/vendor over another.  The above is shared only as a means to gain additional leverage in your negotiations with BMC.   UPDATE: Received add'l info from Belli on List price... sent Jim an update:  Hey Jim,   I wanted to follow-up with a bit more info that I?ve learned.  I was able to get some feedback from one of NPI?s mainframe experts and we believe that we may have figured out list pricing.  If we are correct, the Control-M Platform has a list price of $250/task.  Control-M Base ? Enterprise has a list price of $25K.  If we do the math, $250 * 500 + $25000 * 1 + 20% of licensing for support, the list price for your proposal is $180,000.  Which would mean that you are only receiving a 17.5% discount on this proposal.  NPI considers this pricing to be egregiously overpriced.  As I mentioned before, we have seen these types of purchases reach 75% - 85% discounting.  We recommend that you reach out to BMC and let them know that your market research shows you have meager discounting and this pricing is a non-starter.  This $148K quote should be closer to $50K.",

New offer is SWM at 45%.  Seeing big increase due to Citrix ?packaging? additional features/services into a new support model ?> no longer a-la-carte. ?\tPreviously -- Software updates and support were purchased separately ?\tNew model ? Advertised as ?Customer Support Services?; combines software updates and support, while also expanding and creating a new baseline support tier system o\t3 Tier structure created ? 1. Select, 2.

Priority Plus ?\tPriority Plus appears to have advantages similar to a TRM ?\tRecommend to negotiate price based on an increase due to packaging support features not previously purchased inflating the new baseline price.   No change observed for TRM engagement ? pricing consistent ?\tHowever, the Priority Plus tier may become a reasonable alternative  Closed - FINAL RESULT; feedback from Citrix below....also confirmed no concessions on TRM - holding true to what we typically see...  Thank you for taking the time to express American Family?s concerns with Citrix Maintenance pricing as well as the requirement to have an active agreement in place. We value your business and have voiced your concerns internally to see what can be done to help your organization transition to our new Customer Success Services offering.\u00a0 \u00a0 Renewal Pricing:  \u00a0 As you?re aware, American Family has not made a qualifying purchase to maintain their ELA-6 discount causing contractual pricing to reduce to the ELA-2 discount of 25%. However, given the relationship with American Family and the change in our program, the Citrix team acted in good faith by agreeing to honor the 45% discount on the initial renewal quote.  The additional good news is that we raised your current concerns internally and have secured a concession to temporarily increase American Family?s renewal discount to 53% if a renewal is transacted on-time by 12/27/17.   *Note: This concession is granted for this transaction only and will not permanently change American Family?s maintenance price on future renewals. While you didn?t express an interest in a multiyear commitment, this concession CAN also be utilized if an upfront payment is made. Considering the savings, it may be something to consider.  \u00a0 Summary: \u00a0 We have attached a full quote that includes both Software and Hardware at the concession price. While we understand that all of your requests were not fulfilled, \u00a0this is the best and final that Citrix can offer. We also feel confident that American Family will see the value of our new Customer Success Services offering after you have had a chance to utilize the many new features. I am available to work with you on whatever option you decide so please reach out after you have had a chance to review internally.",
        "customer_comments": "Good improvement.  \u00a0 Xen Desktop Platinum:\u00a0 NPI recommended 50% would be good, shoot for 55% to settle in the middle  Citrix came back at 53% - with a rate of $35.25 >>> rounding discount up from fractional percent, actual @$300k is closer to $35.29  Negligible, about $300 difference for a $300,000 line item Citrix NetScaler SDX 11500 Appliance ? This was not included in the original quote NPI did not provide a recommendation  Quick research, renewing at the previous rate that AmFam received ($8,910 Gold, $4,950 Bronze) ? no change.\u00a0 Remains at past discount of 45% Additional hardware maintenance not provided to NPI for review includes:  Citrix NetScaler SDX 11515 Appliance ? Gold $7,567.40 Citrix NetScaler MPX 8200 Platinum Edition ? Gold $3,917.96 SW and HW TRM ? provided feedback that it is rare to see movement, have seen AmFam receive a one off 10% discount in the past  Citrix renewal is at list  Additional feedback in response could include:  For a purchase of this size any reference to ELA-2 is a bit disingenuous as NPI does not typically see a major enterprise the size of AmFam come in at 25% on a maintenance renewal. In the past we?d expect 25% off Subscription Advantage but this is for an upgraded level of support so that doesn?t apply anymore in our opinion..\u00a0 The movement from a 45% discount to a 53% is a good deal ? if executed then congratulations this is a savings of $53,515. In preparing for your next renewal (2019), track the conversation and progress regarding movement to Customer Success Services during 2018 ? any history that you can maintain and capture regarding any pain points with this migration will be beneficial to bring up during your next renewal cycle.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed Illumio?s proposal to BNYM and found pricing to be within fair market value (FMV), but with some important caveats.  NPI believes BNYM?s potential spend with the vendor represents one of their top accounts, and certainly the most important in the region.  Illumio?s needs this deal immensely, as NPI is aware of several recent implementations in large financial service institutions that have gone awry.  NPI does caution that one of the major issues with these other implementations is around deployment concerns in which several comparable spends saw less than 50% of committed licenses in use by the end of the term, along with a few with usage below 25%.  NPI suggests checking usage of the existing and proposed deployments, as we do see this as a recurring issue.   NPI views the base pricing in this deal to be towards the top of the range in terms of the vendor?s discounting, but BNYM has a significant amount of leverage in this spend due to its importance to Illumio.  Alignment with the vendor?s fiscal quarter end in April further improves BNYM?s position, and any credible doubt that Illumio can create suggesting this transaction could lag into May due to cost pressures will help your position immensely.  NPI cannot emphasize enough how strategic the success of BNYM?s relationship is to Illumio?s wider organization.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI recommends BNYM first confirm your internal usage forecasts and to push Illumio to apply the 74% discount base to the lowest purchase tier.  BNYM should phrase any messaging around these requests as ?necessary to stay within cost parameters and maintain an April timeframe for the deal.? ?\tNPI highly recommends not mentioning any specific discounts or information provided by any benchmarking activities, and to instead focus Illumio on a $4.65M price target that maintains a  o\tNPI suggests confirming usage first, and to focus messaging on a high-level TCO figure that may be even lower than the $4.65M target applied to this full proposal.   ?\tBNYM should feel confident in considering more aggressive discounts if a purchase above 25k new licenses is determined to be within demand forecasts.  While these are the FMV targets in line with what NPI observes in comparable deals, BNYM is in custom territory due to the importance of this deal to the vendor.",

        "current_narrative": "SAS renewals are a bit of a challenge because they aren?t typically benchmarked like other vendors.  We have seen a number of SAS deals and renewals so I was able to do some comparisons on the Software you are renewing.  When we break your renewal cost down to a per user price, your pricing is similar to the pricing we have seen on other SAS renewals.    For example: We have seen SAS Analytics Pro renewal pricing range from $1,437 per user (31 users) to $2,850 per user (1 user).  REI?s SAS Analysis Pro renewal is priced at $2,790 for 2 users.  So by comparison, your pricing is FMV.  Having said that, NPI typically benchmarks a SAS renewal year fees (RYF) based on the first year fees (FYF).  Depending on the size of the initial purchase, discounting can range wildly from 25% up to 70%?s & low 80%?s.  NPI generally advises that RYFs should remain between 27% - 35% of FYFs.  REI should review initial year fees for the products in this renewal to insure that you are in that 27% - 35% range.  If you are, then NPI would consider this pricing to be largely Fair Market Value (FMV).  If you are above 35%, you should point this out to SAS and explain that your finance team has taken notice of it and is holding up this renewal.",

        "current_narrative": "This was 1.0 ... hoping for QGenda docs from Evergreen but they did not come.  Significant scope change... counts were reduced and unit-pricing (per staff) appears to have gone up.  Closing with no savings.  Thanks for sending over your QGenda pricing for NPI to review.  QGenda isn?t one of our strongest vendors, so I had to reach out to one of NPI?s SME?s in our Advisor Network and also gathered some additional information from another NPI hospital client, thanks for your patience while I gathered the additional data.  Overall, NPI finds this pricing to be slightly ABOVE Fair Market Value (FMV) and we recommend that Springfield target reductions in this pricing.  Upfront Costs Beginning with the Upfront fees, these amount to 25% and 31% (26% blended) of the subscription fees.  NPI has typically seen that upfront fees on QGenda implementations are typically 18% - 20% of the net total cost of the licenses.  We recommend targeting 20% of the final license cost.   License Fees The difference in the license fees between the Hospital based staff members and the Float pool are due to additional functionality for the Hospital Based staff members ?Time Tracking and Compensation Management modules. ? Hospital based employees have a recurring annual cost of $324 per staff member, and the Float Pool has a recurring cost of $240 per staff member. ? NPI has seen the base Schedule Automation module priced lower, between $210 - $220 per staff member. ? For the Hospital based staff, the recurring charge is $84 more per year per staff member.  NPI finds this increase for the Time Tracking and Comp Management modules to be FMV.  However, the pricing for the hospital staff should still come down to ~$290 per staff member to account for the slightly overpriced base scheduling fees.  If we are able to achieve $215 base scheduling fees and the upfront charges at 20% of the net license cost, the total first year price tag will be closer to $50K - $51K.  NPI recommends that the messaging to QGenda should focus around budget and potential growth: ?Thank you for sending over this proposal for our review.   Unfortunately in its current form, it may not be executable for us because we just haven?t put this much money into the budget for this project.  I am sure you are aware of the budget issues that Springfield clinic has with the state of Illinois.  Every dollar we spend is going through intense scrutiny and adding funds to a budget line-item is difficult ? if not impossible.   The $12,875 in upfront charges that will come out of our Capital budget is well above the $8,750 that we had expected when we budgeted for this.  Additionally, the $48,000 in recurring license fees have given the finance team a bit of pause.  At these prices, there is concern over the cost of the potential growth of this solution.  I have gained verbal approval for a recurring annual fee of $41,250.  If QGenda is able to meet us at these budgetary numbers, I believe I can get this pushed through by the end of this month, otherwise we may need to wait until the next budgeting cycle later in the year.?    RESPONSE to updated quotes: Hi Arvinder,  Thanks for sending these over.  The Overall pricing is the same as the original quotes that NPI reviewed.  However, they have broken out the Hospital staff cost for the extra Time/Compensation module.  Unfortunately, this actually raises additional questions, such as, why is the base scheduling module charged differently between the two groups?  The recurring annual charge for Hospital staff is $252/user/year, but the Float Pool staff recurring annual fees are $240/user/year.   Springfield may want to question this discrepancy as a side-note to the overall negotiation.  Overall, NPI?s feedback is materially the same as below.  We have seen the scheduling module offered at a lower price and we recommend Springfield use the budget and growth leverage mentioned in the write-up below.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed Illumio?s proposal to BNYM and found pricing to be within fair market value (FMV), but with some important caveats.  NPI believes BNYM?s potential spend with the vendor represents one of their top accounts, and certainly the most important in the region.  Illumio?s needs this deal immensely, as NPI is aware of several recent implementations in large financial service institutions that have gone awry.  NPI does caution that one of the major issues with these other implementations is around deployment concerns in which several comparable spends saw less than 50% of committed licenses in use by the end of the term, along with a few with usage below 25%.  NPI suggests checking usage of the existing and proposed deployments, as we do see this as a recurring issue.   NPI views the base pricing in this deal to be towards the top of the range in terms of the vendor?s discounting, but BNYM has a significant amount of leverage in this spend due to its importance to Illumio.  Alignment with the vendor?s fiscal quarter end in April further improves BNYM?s position, and any credible doubt that Illumio can create suggesting this transaction could lag into May due to cost pressures will help your position immensely.  NPI cannot emphasize enough how strategic the success of BNYM?s relationship is to Illumio?s wider organization.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI recommends BNYM first confirm your internal usage forecasts and to push Illumio to apply the 74% discount base to the lowest purchase tier.  BNYM should phrase any messaging around these requests as ?necessary to stay within cost parameters and maintain an April timeframe for the deal.? ?\tNPI highly recommends not mentioning any specific discounts or information provided by any benchmarking activities, and to instead focus Illumio on a $4.65M price target that maintains a  o\tNPI suggests confirming usage first, and to focus messaging on a high-level TCO figure that may be even lower than the $4.65M target applied to this full proposal.   ?\tBNYM should feel confident in considering more aggressive discounts if a purchase above 25k new licenses is determined to be within demand forecasts.  While these are the FMV targets in line with what NPI observes in comparable deals, BNYM is in custom territory due to the importance of this deal to the vendor.",

        "current_narrative": "This was 1.0 ... hoping for QGenda docs from Evergreen but they did not come.  Significant scope change... counts were reduced and unit-pricing (per staff) appears to have gone up.  Closing with no savings.  Thanks for sending over your QGenda pricing for NPI to review.  QGenda isn?t one of our strongest vendors, so I had to reach out to one of NPI?s SME?s in our Advisor Network and also gathered some additional information from another NPI hospital client, thanks for your patience while I gathered the additional data.  Overall, NPI finds this pricing to be slightly ABOVE Fair Market Value (FMV) and we recommend that Springfield target reductions in this pricing.  Upfront Costs Beginning with the Upfront fees, these amount to 25% and 31% (26% blended) of the subscription fees.  NPI has typically seen that upfront fees on QGenda implementations are typically 18% - 20% of the net total cost of the licenses.  We recommend targeting 20% of the final license cost.   License Fees The difference in the license fees between the Hospital based staff members and the Float pool are due to additional functionality for the Hospital Based staff members ?Time Tracking and Compensation Management modules. ? Hospital based employees have a recurring annual cost of $324 per staff member, and the Float Pool has a recurring cost of $240 per staff member. ? NPI has seen the base Schedule Automation module priced lower, between $210 - $220 per staff member. ? For the Hospital based staff, the recurring charge is $84 more per year per staff member.  NPI finds this increase for the Time Tracking and Comp Management modules to be FMV.  However, the pricing for the hospital staff should still come down to ~$290 per staff member to account for the slightly overpriced base scheduling fees.  If we are able to achieve $215 base scheduling fees and the upfront charges at 20% of the net license cost, the total first year price tag will be closer to $50K - $51K.  NPI recommends that the messaging to QGenda should focus around budget and potential growth: ?Thank you for sending over this proposal for our review.   Unfortunately in its current form, it may not be executable for us because we just haven?t put this much money into the budget for this project.  I am sure you are aware of the budget issues that Springfield clinic has with the state of Illinois.  Every dollar we spend is going through intense scrutiny and adding funds to a budget line-item is difficult ? if not impossible.   The $12,875 in upfront charges that will come out of our Capital budget is well above the $8,750 that we had expected when we budgeted for this.  Additionally, the $48,000 in recurring license fees have given the finance team a bit of pause.  At these prices, there is concern over the cost of the potential growth of this solution.  I have gained verbal approval for a recurring annual fee of $41,250.  If QGenda is able to meet us at these budgetary numbers, I believe I can get this pushed through by the end of this month, otherwise we may need to wait until the next budgeting cycle later in the year.?    RESPONSE to updated quotes: Hi Arvinder,  Thanks for sending these over.  The Overall pricing is the same as the original quotes that NPI reviewed.  However, they have broken out the Hospital staff cost for the extra Time/Compensation module.  Unfortunately, this actually raises additional questions, such as, why is the base scheduling module charged differently between the two groups?  The recurring annual charge for Hospital staff is $252/user/year, but the Float Pool staff recurring annual fees are $240/user/year.   Springfield may want to question this discrepancy as a side-note to the overall negotiation.  Overall, NPI?s feedback is materially the same as below.  We have seen the scheduling module offered at a lower price and we recommend Springfield use the budget and growth leverage mentioned in the write-up below.",

Client agreed to send an email so we can close and move to post project meeting.   2/2/18 - meeting with client today to review cost savings calculations!  1/26/18 - MA details sent to client on 1/25 for review/agreement.  1/19/18- working to schedule post project meeting and receive docs (client requested from reseller)  1/12/18 - Cindy and Rich following up with client to get final docs and schedule post project meeting.  1/4/18 - client communicated with Rich Staas that he has positive feedback for NPI but has been busy. He will follow up and send docs .  12/29/17-  Next step is setting up time on calendar for post project meeting  - to confirm w/Bhall as he is trying to reach them for final docs.  12/22/17 - Bhall following up with client on final paperwork.  12/8/17 - agreed with bhall that if documentation not received by week of 12/11, he will follow up.12/1/17 - following up with client to receive submitted paperwork.  Once received, will schedule post-project meeting and review of MA.  (note to John - let's talk about potentially having you schedule the post-project meeting to push to get completed paperwork) 11/22/17 - NPI awaiting confirmation from client on status of paperwork and agreement details.  Have checked in 11/22 with CIO, Skip  and primary contact Gary. 11/17/17 - MSFT confirmed in writing that signed docs due 11/30/17.  Awaiting confirmation from client on final paperwork.  11/10/17 -escalated to mgmt within MSFT and received favorable new quotes that achieve MDO!  Provided feeback to client regarding Bridge transition CAL (new table on future pricing)  This item is of potential concern.  Once we get clarification, it will either be corrected or CPS will likely be signed as is.  (there are a few other futre pricing items, but client is likely going to pass on another round as they are glad to have met their required budget target) 11/2/17 - client has still not received response from request to MSFT week of 10/23 regarding pricing errors.  Awaiting updated quotes with corrections. 10/27/17 - client met with us briefly on 10/24 and mentioned that MSFT needed them to sign by 10/25 but then MSFT was conveniently not available to answer questions or help at all.  NPI offered additional optimization strategy around SCE and \"price corrections\" on final quote and requested client to have one additional cycle with MSFT.  Client had to cancel meeting on 10/25 due to urgent situation and NPI still awaits status .  10/20/17 - client received updated quotes from MSFT that still do not meet their requirements.  Client is out of town until  10/23/17  and will follow up when they return.   10/13/17 - meeting with client on 10/16 for update from CDW as still no word from MS.   Client had kick off for subscription on 10/12  and expressed how upset he is with the amount of time MSFT is taking to respond.  10/6/17 - no word from Gary since our discussion on 09/29/17.  Sent follow up email to him on evening of 10/5.  09/29/17 - MSFT sent quotes on 092717 and MSFT requested documentation completed by 092917.  NPI (Cindy/Joshua/Bryan) are meeting with client on 29th to discuss issues with MSFT quotes and MDO.  Measurement Agreement has been drafted for presentation to client as well.  9/25/17 - client signed full life-cycle subscription on 8/21/17.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed Illumio?s proposal to BNYM and found pricing to be within fair market value (FMV), but with some important caveats.  NPI believes BNYM?s potential spend with the vendor represents one of their top accounts, and certainly the most important in the region.  Illumio?s needs this deal immensely, as NPI is aware of several recent implementations in large financial service institutions that have gone awry.  NPI does caution that one of the major issues with these other implementations is around deployment concerns in which several comparable spends saw less than 50% of committed licenses in use by the end of the term, along with a few with usage below 25%.  NPI suggests checking usage of the existing and proposed deployments, as we do see this as a recurring issue.   NPI views the base pricing in this deal to be towards the top of the range in terms of the vendor?s discounting, but BNYM has a significant amount of leverage in this spend due to its importance to Illumio.  Alignment with the vendor?s fiscal quarter end in April further improves BNYM?s position, and any credible doubt that Illumio can create suggesting this transaction could lag into May due to cost pressures will help your position immensely.  NPI cannot emphasize enough how strategic the success of BNYM?s relationship is to Illumio?s wider organization.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI recommends BNYM first confirm your internal usage forecasts and to push Illumio to apply the 74% discount base to the lowest purchase tier.  BNYM should phrase any messaging around these requests as ?necessary to stay within cost parameters and maintain an April timeframe for the deal.? ?\tNPI highly recommends not mentioning any specific discounts or information provided by any benchmarking activities, and to instead focus Illumio on a $4.65M price target that maintains a  o\tNPI suggests confirming usage first, and to focus messaging on a high-level TCO figure that may be even lower than the $4.65M target applied to this full proposal.   ?\tBNYM should feel confident in considering more aggressive discounts if a purchase above 25k new licenses is determined to be within demand forecasts.  While these are the FMV targets in line with what NPI observes in comparable deals, BNYM is in custom territory due to the importance of this deal to the vendor.",

The Spectrum products are almost a commodity and CA has given clients high discounts.  With the total spend MS does with CA, the discounts should reflect consideration of your ELA and ELA pricing.  We?ve seen discounts at this volume no less than 54% and on one occasion exceeding 80%.  A client with a much smaller overall CA footprint bought 1100 recently and landed at 54%.  CA is not selling a lot of Spectrum.  There are lots of competitors that can monitor network devices.    MS should get discounts in the 64% to 70% range.  Minimum discount would be 60%.  If CA does not want to discount more, then MS should look at other competitors. While you could make the argument that the FMV targets should be the same since across all three options the net license spend is a narrow $205K-$275K (i.e., the capacity shouldn?t affect the discount), here?s our FMV targets for all three options. ?\t2000 ? 60-66% - target 64% ?\t2500 ? 62-68% - target 66% ?\t3000 ? 64-70% - target 68%  20% maintenance is typical and it appears the year 2 maintenance involves co-terming as it is for 11 months (i.e., when I adjust for 12 months it equates exactly to 20%).  Any savings on support will be indirect and based on the licensing reductions.  Does MS currently use Spectrum?   Is MS replacing another vendor with Spectrum?",

        "current_narrative": "This was 1.0 ... hoping for QGenda docs from Evergreen but they did not come.  Significant scope change... counts were reduced and unit-pricing (per staff) appears to have gone up.  Closing with no savings.  Thanks for sending over your QGenda pricing for NPI to review.  QGenda isn?t one of our strongest vendors, so I had to reach out to one of NPI?s SME?s in our Advisor Network and also gathered some additional information from another NPI hospital client, thanks for your patience while I gathered the additional data.  Overall, NPI finds this pricing to be slightly ABOVE Fair Market Value (FMV) and we recommend that Springfield target reductions in this pricing.  Upfront Costs Beginning with the Upfront fees, these amount to 25% and 31% (26% blended) of the subscription fees.  NPI has typically seen that upfront fees on QGenda implementations are typically 18% - 20% of the net total cost of the licenses.  We recommend targeting 20% of the final license cost.   License Fees The difference in the license fees between the Hospital based staff members and the Float pool are due to additional functionality for the Hospital Based staff members ?Time Tracking and Compensation Management modules. ? Hospital based employees have a recurring annual cost of $324 per staff member, and the Float Pool has a recurring cost of $240 per staff member. ? NPI has seen the base Schedule Automation module priced lower, between $210 - $220 per staff member. ? For the Hospital based staff, the recurring charge is $84 more per year per staff member.  NPI finds this increase for the Time Tracking and Comp Management modules to be FMV.  However, the pricing for the hospital staff should still come down to ~$290 per staff member to account for the slightly overpriced base scheduling fees.  If we are able to achieve $215 base scheduling fees and the upfront charges at 20% of the net license cost, the total first year price tag will be closer to $50K - $51K.  NPI recommends that the messaging to QGenda should focus around budget and potential growth: ?Thank you for sending over this proposal for our review.   Unfortunately in its current form, it may not be executable for us because we just haven?t put this much money into the budget for this project.  I am sure you are aware of the budget issues that Springfield clinic has with the state of Illinois.  Every dollar we spend is going through intense scrutiny and adding funds to a budget line-item is difficult ? if not impossible.   The $12,875 in upfront charges that will come out of our Capital budget is well above the $8,750 that we had expected when we budgeted for this.  Additionally, the $48,000 in recurring license fees have given the finance team a bit of pause.  At these prices, there is concern over the cost of the potential growth of this solution.  I have gained verbal approval for a recurring annual fee of $41,250.  If QGenda is able to meet us at these budgetary numbers, I believe I can get this pushed through by the end of this month, otherwise we may need to wait until the next budgeting cycle later in the year.?    RESPONSE to updated quotes: Hi Arvinder,  Thanks for sending these over.  The Overall pricing is the same as the original quotes that NPI reviewed.  However, they have broken out the Hospital staff cost for the extra Time/Compensation module.  Unfortunately, this actually raises additional questions, such as, why is the base scheduling module charged differently between the two groups?  The recurring annual charge for Hospital staff is $252/user/year, but the Float Pool staff recurring annual fees are $240/user/year.   Springfield may want to question this discrepancy as a side-note to the overall negotiation.  Overall, NPI?s feedback is materially the same as below.  We have seen the scheduling module offered at a lower price and we recommend Springfield use the budget and growth leverage mentioned in the write-up below.",

BNYM?s demand is significant, as the vendor does not have an excessive amount of accounts with 10,000 or more users, and especially not many of those under a 3-year commitment.  GitLab has decent margins on this product even if support call volumes are high, and the long-term agreement would see good incentives passed to the sales team.  The vendor appears to be pushing hard for a decision on this agreement before their fiscal quarter end this month, and terms indicate that this includes a full prepayment of the term.  Even with a limited timeline for negotiations, NPI recommends BNYM create doubt in the sales team?s mind that this deal can proceed in its current form.  NPI sees the DevOps market as fiercely competitive at the moment, and if GitLab?s deal team believes the deal?s health is in question, they will bring their case before the executives in the sales organization for consideration.",

If the GitLab sales team hears messaging that requests specific discounts, their internal systems often interpret this as a ?buy? signal and prevent them from authorizing further concessions.  Conversations focused on net and per user costs do not trigger these alerts, and NPI sees a much greater degree of success when that tract is followed without mentioning discount amounts.",

        "current_narrative": "Had a few iterations.   ?\tAs I always tell clients -- SAS is tough.  It is tough from NPIs perspective because they don?t publish a list price, limit their pricing transparency and their stuff can get complicated. ?\tThere?s some GSA pricing out there that we?ve started leveraging to help understand client pricing but it is never complete enough. ?\tI always encourage clients to push for SAS to show their Standard pricing (list) and make discounts transparent. ?\tI figured I?d start looking at your expiring Supplement to see what could be learned.  I believe your discount on your expiring Supplement was somewhere in the 30% range.   o\tMy two anecdotes for this conclusion is miraculously I was able to validate that $272,700 is the Standard Price (i.e., List) for Enterprise Miner 16 cores.  You actually have your priced for this exact item spelled out in Supplement 53 p.3.  Your first year fees (FYF) is $191,318.  This is just under a 30% discount.   o\tSAS Contextual Analysis is another item with a standalone price in Supp 53.  This has an estimated 35% discount.   o\tSupp 53 was just under $1M.  30-40% is a fine outcome for that spend.  Your second year fees (recurring year fees -RYFs) were 28-29% of FYFs.  The target is 27-35% so those were fine.  Your third year fee is 3% more than year 2.  That is typical.  We sometimes see a 5% increase and 3% is always our target. ?\tNow the new proposal doesn?t share any line item pricing by product.   It also combined some Processor-driven products (40 cores) and some PC licenses. They also muddy slide 7 by showing VIYA?s value.  NPI is unable to determine the aggregated Standard Price for all the products.  While we may be able to come close it would be an inefficient and inaccurate exercise.  ?\tIf you include VIYA?s price and compare the $5,161,240 subtotal to the Net price of $1,911,978 that works out to almost exactly a 63% discount.  On a $5M deal that would be a very strong outcome.  We?d target 55-65%; however, if MetLife doesn?t care about VIYA then the $1.9M is only a 42% discount from what may be the list price (to be validated) of $3.274M.  On this size deal that is a bit light.  50% would be a solid landing spot for that price.  50% off non-VIYA licenses would drive about $280K in year 1 reductions. ?\tRYF in year 2 is 28% exactly.  That?s fine and within FMV but if the FYF drops then this needs to stay at the same 28% level.   ?\tRFY in year 3 is 3% more than year 2. That?s FMV. ?\tInterestingly Option 1 in the prior proposal actually used the word discount implying the $1.315M in that offer was list price (i.e., Standard pricing) and that was a weak but not unexpected 26.5% discount.  Perhaps that means the first row of numbers in each proposal is list pricing. I actually don?t understand why the recurring year fees increases compared to year 1 and weren?t 27-35% of year 1 so I?m glad that option is off the table. Oddly Option 2 in that Proposal v.3 had this same approach which we never see.  I?m closing that file right now. ?\tNPI suggests pushing SAS to show that list price detail or confirm that?s the offer.  At least it does appear they?re increasing the discount compared to Supplement 53 which makes sense as the price is 3x the size.  ?\tAs a side note, there?s also a propensity to discount basic tools like Office Analytics and Access less than what I?d call their Solution-based licenses. Less discounts, less flexibility and a drive to just keep it simpler within SAS. This stuff is well entrenched and people that use it really like it and don?t stop using it.  Because of that they just don?t feel obligated to aggressively discount it.  Because this comprises some of this quote that could be a little downward pressure on discounting but doesn?t need to.  It is their fiscal year end this month.  See attached email for second volley",

I have also included the current contract that is in effect until August 2018 that we are looking to update as well as our requirements (Word document) that we provided to SAS.  Note that SAS has indicated that they have accounted for the 3rd year fees of Supplement into their proposal. Lastly, we are interested in Option 2 (without Model Manager) just because of the VIYA inclusion as a nice to have. However at the end of the day, if they remove VIYA we are OK. The key is needing licenses as global and we can go down to 15 Desktop if need be.  This is anticipated to be a year-end effort and our LOB wants this transaction to be at $2.9M. Please let us know when you think NPI can provide their feedback  Sent a review. Shared feedback.  Tried to gauge prior discounts and current ones with a spot check.  Gave discount targets.  SAS came back with this story:  Per our discussion today, SAS? pricing for this type of a deal structure is based on the total number of cores and maximum number of environments allowed. Based on the strategic nature of this deal we were able to get permission to use a more favorable ?maximum number of environments? quantity to help drive the overall price down.  These would be the standard fees that would be applicable under normal circumstances.?  On the second round of feedback I suggested they push for list pricing.

The Spectrum products are almost a commodity and CA has given clients high discounts.  With the total spend MS does with CA, the discounts should reflect consideration of your ELA and ELA pricing.  We?ve seen discounts at this volume no less than 54% and on one occasion exceeding 80%.  A client with a much smaller overall CA footprint bought 1100 recently and landed at 54%.  CA is not selling a lot of Spectrum.  There are lots of competitors that can monitor network devices.    MS should get discounts in the 64% to 70% range.  Minimum discount would be 60%.  If CA does not want to discount more, then MS should look at other competitors. While you could make the argument that the FMV targets should be the same since across all three options the net license spend is a narrow $205K-$275K (i.e., the capacity shouldn?t affect the discount), here?s our FMV targets for all three options. ?\t2000 ? 60-66% - target 64% ?\t2500 ? 62-68% - target 66% ?\t3000 ? 64-70% - target 68%  20% maintenance is typical and it appears the year 2 maintenance involves co-terming as it is for 11 months (i.e., when I adjust for 12 months it equates exactly to 20%).  Any savings on support will be indirect and based on the licensing reductions.  Does MS currently use Spectrum?   Is MS replacing another vendor with Spectrum?",

When we revisit this it?s worth considering that 2017 YTD we?ve spend an additional $2M on distributed software and about $2.7M on mainframe.   This is in addition to the ELA we paid in Nov 2016.",

        "current_narrative": "This was 1.0 ... hoping for QGenda docs from Evergreen but they did not come.  Significant scope change... counts were reduced and unit-pricing (per staff) appears to have gone up.  Closing with no savings.  Thanks for sending over your QGenda pricing for NPI to review.  QGenda isn?t one of our strongest vendors, so I had to reach out to one of NPI?s SME?s in our Advisor Network and also gathered some additional information from another NPI hospital client, thanks for your patience while I gathered the additional data.  Overall, NPI finds this pricing to be slightly ABOVE Fair Market Value (FMV) and we recommend that Springfield target reductions in this pricing.  Upfront Costs Beginning with the Upfront fees, these amount to 25% and 31% (26% blended) of the subscription fees.  NPI has typically seen that upfront fees on QGenda implementations are typically 18% - 20% of the net total cost of the licenses.  We recommend targeting 20% of the final license cost.   License Fees The difference in the license fees between the Hospital based staff members and the Float pool are due to additional functionality for the Hospital Based staff members ?Time Tracking and Compensation Management modules. ? Hospital based employees have a recurring annual cost of $324 per staff member, and the Float Pool has a recurring cost of $240 per staff member. ? NPI has seen the base Schedule Automation module priced lower, between $210 - $220 per staff member. ? For the Hospital based staff, the recurring charge is $84 more per year per staff member.  NPI finds this increase for the Time Tracking and Comp Management modules to be FMV.  However, the pricing for the hospital staff should still come down to ~$290 per staff member to account for the slightly overpriced base scheduling fees.  If we are able to achieve $215 base scheduling fees and the upfront charges at 20% of the net license cost, the total first year price tag will be closer to $50K - $51K.  NPI recommends that the messaging to QGenda should focus around budget and potential growth: ?Thank you for sending over this proposal for our review.   Unfortunately in its current form, it may not be executable for us because we just haven?t put this much money into the budget for this project.  I am sure you are aware of the budget issues that Springfield clinic has with the state of Illinois.  Every dollar we spend is going through intense scrutiny and adding funds to a budget line-item is difficult ? if not impossible.   The $12,875 in upfront charges that will come out of our Capital budget is well above the $8,750 that we had expected when we budgeted for this.  Additionally, the $48,000 in recurring license fees have given the finance team a bit of pause.  At these prices, there is concern over the cost of the potential growth of this solution.  I have gained verbal approval for a recurring annual fee of $41,250.  If QGenda is able to meet us at these budgetary numbers, I believe I can get this pushed through by the end of this month, otherwise we may need to wait until the next budgeting cycle later in the year.?    RESPONSE to updated quotes: Hi Arvinder,  Thanks for sending these over.  The Overall pricing is the same as the original quotes that NPI reviewed.  However, they have broken out the Hospital staff cost for the extra Time/Compensation module.  Unfortunately, this actually raises additional questions, such as, why is the base scheduling module charged differently between the two groups?  The recurring annual charge for Hospital staff is $252/user/year, but the Float Pool staff recurring annual fees are $240/user/year.   Springfield may want to question this discrepancy as a side-note to the overall negotiation.  Overall, NPI?s feedback is materially the same as below.  We have seen the scheduling module offered at a lower price and we recommend Springfield use the budget and growth leverage mentioned in the write-up below.",

Client agreed to send an email so we can close and move to post project meeting.   2/2/18 - meeting with client today to review cost savings calculations!  1/26/18 - MA details sent to client on 1/25 for review/agreement.  1/19/18- working to schedule post project meeting and receive docs (client requested from reseller)  1/12/18 - Cindy and Rich following up with client to get final docs and schedule post project meeting.  1/4/18 - client communicated with Rich Staas that he has positive feedback for NPI but has been busy. He will follow up and send docs .  12/29/17-  Next step is setting up time on calendar for post project meeting  - to confirm w/Bhall as he is trying to reach them for final docs.  12/22/17 - Bhall following up with client on final paperwork.  12/8/17 - agreed with bhall that if documentation not received by week of 12/11, he will follow up.12/1/17 - following up with client to receive submitted paperwork.  Once received, will schedule post-project meeting and review of MA.  (note to John - let's talk about potentially having you schedule the post-project meeting to push to get completed paperwork) 11/22/17 - NPI awaiting confirmation from client on status of paperwork and agreement details.  Have checked in 11/22 with CIO, Skip  and primary contact Gary. 11/17/17 - MSFT confirmed in writing that signed docs due 11/30/17.  Awaiting confirmation from client on final paperwork.  11/10/17 -escalated to mgmt within MSFT and received favorable new quotes that achieve MDO!  Provided feeback to client regarding Bridge transition CAL (new table on future pricing)  This item is of potential concern.  Once we get clarification, it will either be corrected or CPS will likely be signed as is.  (there are a few other futre pricing items, but client is likely going to pass on another round as they are glad to have met their required budget target) 11/2/17 - client has still not received response from request to MSFT week of 10/23 regarding pricing errors.  Awaiting updated quotes with corrections. 10/27/17 - client met with us briefly on 10/24 and mentioned that MSFT needed them to sign by 10/25 but then MSFT was conveniently not available to answer questions or help at all.  NPI offered additional optimization strategy around SCE and \"price corrections\" on final quote and requested client to have one additional cycle with MSFT.  Client had to cancel meeting on 10/25 due to urgent situation and NPI still awaits status .  10/20/17 - client received updated quotes from MSFT that still do not meet their requirements.  Client is out of town until  10/23/17  and will follow up when they return.   10/13/17 - meeting with client on 10/16 for update from CDW as still no word from MS.   Client had kick off for subscription on 10/12  and expressed how upset he is with the amount of time MSFT is taking to respond.  10/6/17 - no word from Gary since our discussion on 09/29/17.  Sent follow up email to him on evening of 10/5.  09/29/17 - MSFT sent quotes on 092717 and MSFT requested documentation completed by 092917.  NPI (Cindy/Joshua/Bryan) are meeting with client on 29th to discuss issues with MSFT quotes and MDO.  Measurement Agreement has been drafted for presentation to client as well.  9/25/17 - client signed full life-cycle subscription on 8/21/17.",

BNYM?s demand is significant, as the vendor does not have an excessive amount of accounts with 10,000 or more users, and especially not many of those under a 3-year commitment.  GitLab has decent margins on this product even if support call volumes are high, and the long-term agreement would see good incentives passed to the sales team.  The vendor appears to be pushing hard for a decision on this agreement before their fiscal quarter end this month, and terms indicate that this includes a full prepayment of the term.  Even with a limited timeline for negotiations, NPI recommends BNYM create doubt in the sales team?s mind that this deal can proceed in its current form.  NPI sees the DevOps market as fiercely competitive at the moment, and if GitLab?s deal team believes the deal?s health is in question, they will bring their case before the executives in the sales organization for consideration.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI recommends focusing messaging on a $4.0M even target presented to GitLab as the level at which BNYM can maintain the current deal timeline.   ?\tNPI highly recommends not mentioning specific discount amounts or benchmarking tied to this deal at all, and instead focus GitLab on the larger annual and full-term costs.  If the GitLab sales team hears messaging that requests specific discounts, their internal systems often interpret this as a ?buy? signal and prevent them from authorizing further concessions.  Conversations focused on net and per user costs do not trigger these alerts, and NPI sees a much greater degree of success when that tract is followed without mentioning discount amounts.",

        "current_narrative": "No financials because this was a review of 3-vendors....   Hi Lucy,  Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.   I can appreciate the urgency and we tried to get you some information as quickly as we can.  We get a number of requests from Intuit and based on NPI?s contract with Intuit, our turnaround times are typically 4 to 5 business days.  We always strive to respond quicker, but 4 to 5 days is where most reviews will end up.  If we get too many urgent requests that jump the line, it can affect the turnaround times on other reviews we are doing for Intuit and other clients.  For future reviews, it would be best to prepare for a 4 - 5 day turnaround time for feedback from NPI.  This is a bit different than the type of reviews NPI typically does.  Intuit is seeking guidance to subscribe to licensing as an MSP or distributor, rather than as the consumer of a product or service themselves. While this is not the 1st time that we have done such a review for Intuit, and specifically for one of these three vendors, Symantec, this is not a type of transaction that we see often.  We have looked at this review in terms of the pure numbers, but the pricing model may be slightly different, so Intuit should keep that in mind as you review the information below.  Almost a year ago, Intuit asked NPI to review a renewal of Quick Online Backup Services. At that time, Intuit was comparing numerous vendors, including Symantec, for the sole purpose of Intuit buying online backup service wholesale from Norton (Symantec) and selling it to users of Intuit Online.   At the time, NPI offered Intuit the following advice, beyond the hard data surrounding market information on storage pricing:     Fast forward to this moment in time and again Norton (Symantec) is in the mix, this time pitted against Bitdefender and McAfee. While Bitdefender has been in business for 15 years, they have not had much success penetrating NPI?s client base and NPI has relatively small data by comparison to our Symantec and McAfee experience.  NPI was a bit surprised by McAfee?s attempt by to bolster their proposal with 5 pages of data that is all immediately accessible on their website:     In fact, the only truly compelling information provided, unless Intuit is strongly considering becoming a reseller or distributor for McAfee, is found on page 7. On page 7, we find the pricing information that shows that the offer from McAfee, based on a one year model represents an 89% discount from their MSRP for a single instance of their software. The 3 year annually paid offer improves this position to 91% off of MSRP and finally the 3 year pre-paid offer is almost 94% off of MSRP.  Comparing these price points from Symantec and McAfee, to those of the MSP model Bitdefender proposal, we find a mixed bag of higher and lower positions, based on time committed to and consumed licenses.  Both the offers from Bitdefender and McAfee appear to be far more competitively priced by comparison to the Symantec offer at a minimum of $13.99 per subscription, however, Symantec already has a presence within Intuit and Intuit?s Quickbook offering and, as such is probably expected to perform more favorably. At an 86% discount from list, Symantec?s discount is aggressive, but if compared to similarly sized transactions from Symantec, it falls a bit short of the 94% best-in-class discounting that NPI has seen in the past. If we take the simplest of views, NPI could apply the 100K licensing model to Symantec?s pricing, and produce a list price of $9.99M and a discounted price of $1.39M, or 86%. The target discount of 94% would result in net price of $600,000 or a reduction of almost $700K and furthermore, would bring the per license costs in-line with the other two provider proposals.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed Sony?s Netskope proposal and found pricing to be above fair market value (FMV). Cloud access security broker (CASB) solutions are a newer but expanding technology. The major players in the space are entering a growth phase with a focus on maximizing market share. This atmosphere presents opportunities for purchasing teams, as many deals NPI reviews are put on hold while the technology is still being evaluated. The presence of an existing CASB solution at Sony, Cisco?s Cloudlock, means that even though there?s a desire to switch to a new product, Netskope?s team will be wary of the remote possibility that you could stay with Cisco. NPI does see cases where Netskope has the more complete solution and is the technical preference, but Cisco wins the business due to massive price cuts. There have also been cases where Cisco?s status as a major OEM places them as a preapproved vendor, and internal controls have steered clients towards Cloudlock merely because of the much smaller size of Netskope with its less than 450 employees. This is in no way intended to ca doubt on Netskope?s operational capability or product quality (NPI hears Sony?s technical preference for Netskope echoed in many other competitive CASB deals), but it does give insight into issues that the sales teams and resellers encounter. The potential for uncertainty can provide a good deal of leverage to Sony to target further reductions over the 3-year term, or even better pricing around a 1 ? 2-year agreement.",

While there?s already been some reductions in the 3-year deal, FMV net pricing for this would be in the $450,000 - $500,000 range, amounting to a combined user cost of $50 per subscription per year for the term separate support.   NPI sees a wide range of prices offered for this solution, with higher volumes achieving as low as $20 per user per year for Netskope?s entire platform.    NPI sees Netskope restricting the number of sanctioned cloud applications in some proposals, with additional applications adding to per-user costs. This deal?s unlimited allowance for the cloud services Netskope covers has a positive influence on the FMV assessment.   It could take some time to deploy, fully train, and gain full value out of the total 2,700 user subscriptions. To accommodate for a 1 ? 2+ month lead time, Sony could push for a small proration discount in the first year to balance this shelfware risk.   Timing that aligns with vendor/reseller fiscal calendars could help build leverage. With Cloudlock as an existing solution, it would be credible to Optiv and Netskope that this deal could lag into or past December.",

        "current_narrative": "As always, thank you for reaching out to NPI concerning the migration from CloudHealth to YotaScale. Apologies for not getting back you yesterday. I hope this information is still useful and relevant.  Unfortunately, for as much information as NPI has about cloud services in general and AWS services and other iAAS providers, we simply don?t have that much data when it comes to YotaScale.  This should not come as a surprise, considering that they have only 24 employees listed on LinkedIn, several of which are board members and advisors, and they have only been in business since 2015. In fact, YotaScale is largely still living on funding, not revenue, and is still largely a fledgling company:   YotaScale, Inc. is a Silicon Valley startup that is defining infrastructure performance management for the cloud. It is funded by Pelion Venture Partners and Engineering Capital.  YotaScale rec?d $3.6M in funding just over one year ago. From a late 2017 Diginomica article, I gleaned the following excerpt:   As public cloud use proliferates and grows more comprehensive among large enterprises, the difficulty of tracking resource usage, spending and performance is an opportunity for software intelligence and automation. Vendors have cost management services like AWS Cost Explorer. However, these can flood users with data and don?t do a solid job of summarizing it by application, project or department, nor do they provide much help in identifying usage anomalies or their cause. These are just the sorts of insights software from YotaScale, a quasi-stealth startup, seeks to provide by applying machine learning to cloud workload and cost analysis as part of what co-founder and CEO Asim Razzaq calls ?AI-enhanced Infrastructure Performance Management.?  One thing that I can tell you is that the Waterfall pricing method that they are offering is likely receiving push back from clients other than Intuit. This idea that your initial investment continues to be penalized borders on the absurd. There is little incentive to grow your consumption (which Intuit certainly will) under this model. Intuit should push back and either invite YotaScale to lower the cost per EC2 instance to the $1/per offered in the 40K tier, or to change the terms such that when Intuit reaches the next volume tier all of the consumption is repriced to the next tier up.   Intuit does not often prepay for services, but in this particular case, given the commitment of less than $0.5M/year, and the ability to offset the cost of this service, if Intuit offered the cash hungry YotaScale a 3-year prepayment, you could likely push the offer from 15% to 20% and then gain an add?l 5-10% as a referenceable account.  Has Intuit conducted a POC with YotaScale, and if so, NPI assumes it was successful?  In closing, if Intuit is committed to the start-up tech that YotaScale offers, offering a 3-year deal at $1M may carry a lot of weight to company that is certainly hungry for a notable win.",

        "current_narrative": "Chris, NPI has completed our review.  We?ve seen quite a bit of Nutanix of late. We?ve seen some clear discount ranges across hardware, software and support and have seen them flex within that range depending on all the usual purchase factors (i.e., leverage with budget, timing, competition).  Springfield?s quote has a list price of just over $1M and a net offer of $587K.  Our line item breakdown by spend category is as follows: ?\tHardware ? line item discount is 40.5%.  Comprising about 70% of the quote.  NPIs FMV discount range is 40-60% so they?re right at the bottom of our range.  The mid to high 50s is probably more in line with a bit bigger purchases so we believe 50% is the right target. ?\tSupport is discounted 21%.  This is a typical discount.  A second way NPI views this is the support cost per node.  If you take the support costs and divide it by the license quantity of each piece of hardware you arrive at ~$11,800 for both the 8235s and 8135.  NPIs target is $10K for this as $12K is the upper part of our FMV range. ?\tLicenses often come with sizable discounts.  Both licenses have a line item discount of 47.3%.  On sizable purchases above $2M list we?ve seen discounts approach 80%.  For this size purchase NPIs FMV range is 50-65%.  We?ve established a 60% target based on the net license spend totaling under $100K. ?\tServices are rarely discounted and NPI doesn?t see much opportunity there. ?\tNPI re-ran the numbers using 50% for HW, 60% for SW and Support at $10K/mode (attached file) o\tOur target total calculates to $536K o\tSpringfield?s line item offer is $639K which would be a $103K further reduction BUT?. o\tThere?s also a $52K one-time discount which cuts that in half; therefore, o\tNPIs adjusted savings target is another $51K.  The attached Excel file reflects the offer and NPIs FMV targets.  It is set up to print to one page.",

As this project was a \"QSE Event\" no savings calculations will be measured.  2/9/18 - no additional communications from Paola.  2/2/18 - Paola intends to finalize agreements by end of day today.  We have not seen any updates from MSFT but have offered help.  1/26/18 - no update from Flowserve.  Will cancel Monday meeting at end of day on 1/26 if we have not heard from them.   1/19/18 - no update since last week - will cancel meeting on 1/22 - works well as Cindy will be traveling and unavailable at meeting time.  1/12/18 - met with client on 1/9/18 and provided feedback for next steps - 2 prong approach with both account team as well as escalation to Microsoft Regional VP. 1/4/18 - received MSFT quote from client and held call with Paola and Earl.  Provided assessment of SCE and EAS CPS.   These were only docs provided.   Client has undergone numerous reiterations and communications w/MSFT without NPI involvement per their request to structure the project to best suit their needs vs. NPI methodology.  12/29/17 - reached out to client on 12/28, no response yet.  Will likely cancel status meeting on January 2. 12/22/17 - NPI is following client's request to not have any meetings until Flowserve shares MSFT quote. Sent email to check in with client on 12/21.  12/8/17 - awaiting quotes from MSFT and scaling back discovery at client's request.   12/1/17 - Flowserve has delayed their request to MSFT to provide updated quotes.  We have requested that they please move forward in at least requesting from LAR.  Awaiting these and MLS as well. Held an initial discovery meeting with 4 product areas/topics that require follow up.  11/22/17 - primary contact has returned but was unable to meet with NPI week of 11/20.  Cindy sent details on specifics that we need to discuss and request for Flowserve to sent quotes and MLS as soon as they are available.  Reminded client to please folllow up with MSFT and Software One to get these ASAP. 11/17/17 -primary contact out through 11/20.  Met with Gabriel from IT to discuss E4 plans and cloud vs. on-prem.  Need additional interviews scheduled to keep project on track. Quote due back on 11/17.  11/10/17 - kick off call held 11/7 and project plan meeting on 11/8.  We made our way through a good list of action items but more to go and key contact Jennifer is now out until 11/20,  Shooting for a few interviews the week of 11/13.",

        "current_narrative": "Jim, Here?s our thinking. This required more creative analysis mixed with some benchmarking.  In sum, I don?t think this pricing is good enough considering your expansion.  When checking our data it was clear that basically all of our prior Flexera reviews were for perpetual license deals.  We had some data points on 2012 list pricing and 2014 list pricing.  Neither price list had a Suite price but there were some interesting learnings that may apply.  ?\tIn the perpetual license reviews the total quantity always applied to FlexNet Manager Platform.  The total for all the ?connector? licenses e.g., for Servicenow, or for Adobe would then sum to that same Platform count.  While I?m not sure how this works in the Cloud it would lead me to conclude MetLife really has 62,500 platform (or suite) licenses and you can use them for 62,500 various connectors and you don?t have 62,500 connectors to Adobe and 62,500 connectors to Microsoft.  Is that the case and how you interpret that?  ?\tWhile there?s clearly value in having the flexibility of the Suite which is noted in this attached article - http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/flexera-software-enhances-flexnet-manager-suite-on-demand-providing-broadest-software-1875394.htm this was a key observation as NPI did some creative analysis ?\tFlexera doesn?t publish a list price but NPI has two sets of price lists.  One from a detailed GSA document in 2012 and some abbreviated pricing from a client?s 2014 offer.  One key observation was it appeared that Flexera had some HUGE price increases between 2012 and 2014.  NPI decided to use our view of 2014 list pricing to analyze your current pricing.  This fits because you executed your current deal around that time. ?\tTo note again, we don?t have Cloud list pricing now or from 2014.  Flexera has a number of tiers based on volume for all the perpetual licenses. o\tThere?s a number of ways to cut it but from a perpetual license POV for these volumes I estimate the list price for the Platform and one connector (of which you have 62,500) is $18.50.  o\tAt these volumes we?d expect a discount near 40% for a net price of around $11.   o\tThere?s likely five ways to think about how you can compare a perpetual license cost to a Cloud option.  For example with Splunk if a perpetual license costs $100, then a term license is 40% of that or $40 and a Cloud license is 1.33 times that or about $53.  So the Cloud works out to 50% of the perpetual cost.  The inflection point is often at 2.5-3.5 years where the TCOs intersect.  Perpetual will have annual support as well. o\tTo simplify, if the net target for the perpetual license is $11 then if that?s 2.5 the cost of a Cloud option the target would be $4.50.   o\tMetLife?s current contract works out to $11.80. That?s the $2.95M all-in total which is $737.5K a year divided by 62,500. o\tIf you allow for a bit lower discounts since Cloud usually experiences that vs. perpetual, and if I round up wherever I could in my analysis then maybe I end up at $7-8. ?\tIn sum, I don?t have a perfect benchmark for the cost of Cloud FlexNet Manager Suite at your volumes but using the data at hand and analyzing a perpetual license purchase and using a reasonable conversion approach I conclude there?s a good amount of room to improve this price as you seek a global footprint. ?\tConsider asking them for a quote with list pricing for both perpetual and Cloud.  Let them know you are aware there are significant reductions to list price based on tiers and review those.   In perpetual license model the tiers at the high end have been 50000-74999; 75000-99999; 100000-149999; 150000-199999; 200000-249999 and they keep going.  Sometime we don?t see tiers with Cloud but if you surface your knowledge of tiers with perpetual licenses then you can raise the expectation that as Cloud tiers increase the price should go down.  In the high volumes each tier has a 3-8% drop in the respective list price.  Can talk you through this more but this should get the general message across.    Jim shared this vendor message: Jim,  Spoke to my management team.  Went through the normal questions around why the contractually agreed upon rate wasn?t good for this final year add-on.  What I can offer amounts to 9% additional discount for the 15k endpoints with a confirmation it will close by EOY.  Budgetary Estimate:  Contractually ? 15k endpoints for one year at $11.80 or $177,700 Concession for EOY - 15k endpoints for one year at $10.74 or $161,100  Know this is not what you were looking for yet what I could get approved.  and then Jim said: \"FYI.. don?t think I will be able to further reduce the fees.\"",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed BNYM?s 3-year offer from GitLab and found pricing to be above fair market value (FMV) for the combined spend.  BNYM?s demand is significant, as the vendor does not have an excessive amount of accounts with 10,000 or more users, and especially not many of those under a 3-year commitment.  GitLab has decent margins on this product even if support call volumes are high, and the long-term agreement would see good incentives passed to the sales team.  The vendor appears to be pushing hard for a decision on this agreement before their fiscal quarter end this month, and terms indicate that this includes a full prepayment of the term.  Even with a limited timeline for negotiations, NPI recommends BNYM create doubt in the sales team?s mind that this deal can proceed in its current form.  NPI sees the DevOps market as fiercely competitive at the moment, and if GitLab?s deal team believes the deal?s health is in question, they will bring their case before the executives in the sales organization for consideration.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI recommends focusing messaging on a $4.0M even target presented to GitLab as the level at which BNYM can maintain the current deal timeline.   ?\tNPI highly recommends not mentioning specific discount amounts or benchmarking tied to this deal at all, and instead focus GitLab on the larger annual and full-term costs.  If the GitLab sales team hears messaging that requests specific discounts, their internal systems often interpret this as a ?buy? signal and prevent them from authorizing further concessions.  Conversations focused on net and per user costs do not trigger these alerts, and NPI sees a much greater degree of success when that tract is followed without mentioning discount amounts.",

        "current_narrative": "No financials because this was a review of 3-vendors....   Hi Lucy,  Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.   I can appreciate the urgency and we tried to get you some information as quickly as we can.  We get a number of requests from Intuit and based on NPI?s contract with Intuit, our turnaround times are typically 4 to 5 business days.  We always strive to respond quicker, but 4 to 5 days is where most reviews will end up.  If we get too many urgent requests that jump the line, it can affect the turnaround times on other reviews we are doing for Intuit and other clients.  For future reviews, it would be best to prepare for a 4 - 5 day turnaround time for feedback from NPI.  This is a bit different than the type of reviews NPI typically does.  Intuit is seeking guidance to subscribe to licensing as an MSP or distributor, rather than as the consumer of a product or service themselves. While this is not the 1st time that we have done such a review for Intuit, and specifically for one of these three vendors, Symantec, this is not a type of transaction that we see often.  We have looked at this review in terms of the pure numbers, but the pricing model may be slightly different, so Intuit should keep that in mind as you review the information below.  Almost a year ago, Intuit asked NPI to review a renewal of Quick Online Backup Services. At that time, Intuit was comparing numerous vendors, including Symantec, for the sole purpose of Intuit buying online backup service wholesale from Norton (Symantec) and selling it to users of Intuit Online.   At the time, NPI offered Intuit the following advice, beyond the hard data surrounding market information on storage pricing:     Fast forward to this moment in time and again Norton (Symantec) is in the mix, this time pitted against Bitdefender and McAfee. While Bitdefender has been in business for 15 years, they have not had much success penetrating NPI?s client base and NPI has relatively small data by comparison to our Symantec and McAfee experience.  NPI was a bit surprised by McAfee?s attempt by to bolster their proposal with 5 pages of data that is all immediately accessible on their website:     In fact, the only truly compelling information provided, unless Intuit is strongly considering becoming a reseller or distributor for McAfee, is found on page 7. On page 7, we find the pricing information that shows that the offer from McAfee, based on a one year model represents an 89% discount from their MSRP for a single instance of their software. The 3 year annually paid offer improves this position to 91% off of MSRP and finally the 3 year pre-paid offer is almost 94% off of MSRP.  Comparing these price points from Symantec and McAfee, to those of the MSP model Bitdefender proposal, we find a mixed bag of higher and lower positions, based on time committed to and consumed licenses.  Both the offers from Bitdefender and McAfee appear to be far more competitively priced by comparison to the Symantec offer at a minimum of $13.99 per subscription, however, Symantec already has a presence within Intuit and Intuit?s Quickbook offering and, as such is probably expected to perform more favorably. At an 86% discount from list, Symantec?s discount is aggressive, but if compared to similarly sized transactions from Symantec, it falls a bit short of the 94% best-in-class discounting that NPI has seen in the past. If we take the simplest of views, NPI could apply the 100K licensing model to Symantec?s pricing, and produce a list price of $9.99M and a discounted price of $1.39M, or 86%. The target discount of 94% would result in net price of $600,000 or a reduction of almost $700K and furthermore, would bring the per license costs in-line with the other two provider proposals.",

We have been reluctant to renew because we were informed the 9x5 support option is no longer going to be available so we are forced to an option we will never use (24x7 support).  I attached the email with the most recent quotes we received from Avnet (our VAR) and HP.  Im also including last year?s quote as well.  It can be confusing because there are several line items they are trying to co-term with August 2018.  We were told the move to 24x7 only would add about a 25% increase in 2017.  1.\tDoes the pricing look in-line with the industry? 2.\tThey told us they are going to 24x7 support only option because that is where the industry is moving.

        "current_narrative": "Pricing Analysis ?\tNPI combined both proposals to provide a consolidated view of the Brocade hardware renewal.    SEE FMV for details.  The NPI analysis of the Brocade proposals finds the various discounting on the models to be unusual for a Brocade renewal.   The majority of the HW in this renewal is less than 5 years old as stated by Morgan Stanley.  As HW increases in age, hardware manufacturers will often begin a steady increase in maintenance costs to ?encourage? a hardware refresh.    Data shows the typical 5% Y/Y increase on many of the items yet tied to the unusual discounting, NPI is also seeing some unusual increases and decreases (which appear to be tied to a reduction in support levels). It makes for a lot of moving parts year over year.  NPI calculated a blended discount rate of 30.9% and finds discount to be below our FMV range.  NPI will often see discounts in the 40% - 45% range for renewals near the $1M range.  NPI does not see any particular rationale as to why discounting should vary between hardware models and recommends a FMV target of a straight 47% on all SKUs.  In this exercise, NPI actually reduced discounts on some SKUs (that NPI believed to be unusually high) to the same 47%.  Achieving this target will result in a savings of $180K.  The FMV target of 47% on all renewal SKUs would be considered ?best-in-classs? pricing.  NPI is targeting this level of pricing because of the potential sales opportunities that MS is considering in the near future.  Premier Onsite Support Engineer (OSE) is currently discounted at 33%.  NPI targets $192,000 or a 40% discount as FMV.  This FMV target will land the OSE at $96/hr.   Achieving this target will result in $24,000 in additional savings.  Targets and negotiation bullets in FMV.",

        "current_narrative": "See email attached for cleaner view of feedback:  Hi Johan,  Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  We have seen a number of Checkmarx deals, in fact, we?ve seen a few from Intuit, so we know that Intuit has spent a few million dollars with Checkmarx over the past couple of years.  In our write-up below, you will see that NPI believes this pricing is ABOVE Fair Market Value (FMV) based on a) projected usage and, b) Intuit?s overall spend with Checkmarx over the past 12 ? 24 months.  It is difficult to benchmark this Codebashing quote because all of Codebashing?s developer modules are available to every developer, so the true market value will depend heavily on the actual consumption of training modules.  ? The proposal from Checkmarx?s Codebashing is offering 4,500 users access to all lessons and languages for a discounted price of $133/user/year.  Currently, Codebashing offers a total of 164 modules over 9 different languages (as per their website), effectively placing the annual cost per module at $0.81/user/year. o While pricing at $0.81/user/year is certainly considered FMV, NPI recommends an internal review as to the realistic expectations of actual consumption.   ? On average, there are ~22 courses for each of the 9 programming languages.   ? If developers focus their coding to a smaller subset of the offered programming languages, will the developers complete the training modules for languages they do not focus on?  Is the realistic consumption of the modules at 100%, 80%, 20%?  Actual consumption will potentially drive cost/user significantly higher (and likely above FMV). o Due to our believe that actual consumption will be significantly lower than 100%, NPI considers the pricing in this quote to be ABOVE (FMV). ? NPI suggests the creation of a matrix, similar to the sample below, be used as a negotiating data point as to why Intuit pricing overall needs to be further reduced.  The two primary variables that will need to be researched by Intuit are the developer #s and estimated use by each developer.  SAMPLE Projection of Value           Language # of Courses Developer #s List Price/Module List Per Language Price Est. Use Adj. List Price Java 22 3500 $ 2.13  $ 164,010  40% $65,604  .net 22 1000 $ 2.13  $ 46,860  40% $18,744  php 22 3000 $ 2.13  $ 140,580  40% $56,232  node.js 22 2500 $ 2.13  $ 117,150  40% $46,860  Ruby on Rails 22 2500 $ 2.13  $ 117,150  40% $46,860  Python 22 3000 $ 2.13  $ 140,580  40% $56,232  C++ 16 1000 $ 2.13  $ 34,080  40% $13,632  Android 8 1200 $ 2.13  $ 20,448  40% $8,179  iOS 8 1400 $ 2.13  $ 23,856  40% $9,542  Total 164   $ 804,714   $321,886         ? Once Intuit has calculated the Adjusted List Price, remember it is just that? LIST price, and a nominal 15% - 25% reduction should still be applied to that adjusted LIST price. ? NPI expects that there will be a number of developers that are well-versed in multiple languages.  We recommend that Intuit recognize that developer ?burn-out? is likely if they are asked to review modules from multiple categories.  This argument can be used to defend the lower estimated use figure. ? Checkmarx will typically offer deeper discounts to get the total contract pricing closer to the projected pricing that reflects Intuit?s calculations.",

Feedback was high-level.. didn't really recommend savings:  Thanks for letting NPI review this and provide feedback.  Overall, NPI considers the pricing on these NEW devices to be within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV).  We recommend that Springfield should consider refurbished equipment because it would be priced significantly lower and in this market, refurbished equipment often comes with the same warranties, etc.  Attached is a spreadsheet comparing 2 quotes for 2 different sites from 2 vendors, Consolidated and ConvergeOne. It appears both represent upgrades to R7.x CM's, with multiple Gateway sites remote to each Core.  Consolidated has 10, Springfield has 8.  Both sites are adding 600 9608 sets to each location, several port cards for end users and T'1's. It appears that the Springfield site had a co-term support contract quote for SA, while the Mattoon site has a 3 year annual SA UA quote.  We attempted to line up like for like material codes, or similar codes based on the target support outcome, so when you look at SS you will see side by side. We ignored a few small items like cables etc.  Additional Notes: 1.\tThere are minor price differences between the vendors, however, if the intent is to choose one vendor for both sites, we recommend that Springfield get quotes for each site from both vendors, including installation, support, upgrade protection. 2.\tSpringfield will want to require the same Project manager for both sites, and if appropriate an SPOC on the client end. Really a pain to deal with different PM's, waste a lot of time reviewing. 3.\tRequire a test plan for failover testing out of hours for GW site 4.\tVerify VMware software compatibility with the Avaya load, should have been tested; so trust but verify. 5.\tAsk for references for similar upgrades, paying particular attention to the Gateway sites. Not a recommendation, I know from personal experience C1 has a track record for this kind of upgrade. 6.\tIt was mentioned that Springfield intends to have a spare 8300 processor to use as you upgrade the individual sites....that works very well, saves a lot of time and hassle. 7.\tOn both designs , Springfield should look at refurbished pricing for the MM circuit cards. Quote totals are about $7700 for the 5 cards. We believe these can get the total below $4000 refurbished cards are available.  C1 will offer a one year warranty. On the phone sets it looks like C1 is offering a 3 year warranty on the 9608's. As you can see from the totals, there is very little difference in pricing.  C1 install costs are higher, but other costs offset the difference, however, support costs are only 8 months, while the Consolidated quote represents annual costs for 12 months. On Avaya proposals, TCO is greatly affected by support and upgrade costs, so this would give the slightest edge to the Consolidated pricing.",

We have not seen any updates from MSFT but have offered help.  1/26/18 - no update from Flowserve.  Will cancel Monday meeting at end of day on 1/26 if we have not heard from them.   1/19/18 - no update since last week - will cancel meeting on 1/22 - works well as Cindy will be traveling and unavailable at meeting time.  1/12/18 - met with client on 1/9/18 and provided feedback for next steps - 2 prong approach with both account team as well as escalation to Microsoft Regional VP. 1/4/18 - received MSFT quote from client and held call with Paola and Earl.  Provided assessment of SCE and EAS CPS.   These were only docs provided.   Client has undergone numerous reiterations and communications w/MSFT without NPI involvement per their request to structure the project to best suit their needs vs. NPI methodology.  12/29/17 - reached out to client on 12/28, no response yet.  Will likely cancel status meeting on January 2. 12/22/17 - NPI is following client's request to not have any meetings until Flowserve shares MSFT quote. Sent email to check in with client on 12/21.  12/8/17 - awaiting quotes from MSFT and scaling back discovery at client's request.   12/1/17 - Flowserve has delayed their request to MSFT to provide updated quotes.  We have requested that they please move forward in at least requesting from LAR.  Awaiting these and MLS as well. Held an initial discovery meeting with 4 product areas/topics that require follow up.  11/22/17 - primary contact has returned but was unable to meet with NPI week of 11/20.  Cindy sent details on specifics that we need to discuss and request for Flowserve to sent quotes and MLS as soon as they are available.  Reminded client to please folllow up with MSFT and Software One to get these ASAP. 11/17/17 -primary contact out through 11/20.  Met with Gabriel from IT to discuss E4 plans and cloud vs. on-prem.  Need additional interviews scheduled to keep project on track. Quote due back on 11/17.  11/10/17 - kick off call held 11/7 and project plan meeting on 11/8.  We made our way through a good list of action items but more to go and key contact Jennifer is now out until 11/20,  Shooting for a few interviews the week of 11/13.",

        "current_narrative": "Jim, Here?s our thinking. This required more creative analysis mixed with some benchmarking.  In sum, I don?t think this pricing is good enough considering your expansion.  When checking our data it was clear that basically all of our prior Flexera reviews were for perpetual license deals.  We had some data points on 2012 list pricing and 2014 list pricing.  Neither price list had a Suite price but there were some interesting learnings that may apply.  ?\tIn the perpetual license reviews the total quantity always applied to FlexNet Manager Platform.  The total for all the ?connector? licenses e.g., for Servicenow, or for Adobe would then sum to that same Platform count.  While I?m not sure how this works in the Cloud it would lead me to conclude MetLife really has 62,500 platform (or suite) licenses and you can use them for 62,500 various connectors and you don?t have 62,500 connectors to Adobe and 62,500 connectors to Microsoft.  Is that the case and how you interpret that?  ?\tWhile there?s clearly value in having the flexibility of the Suite which is noted in this attached article - http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/flexera-software-enhances-flexnet-manager-suite-on-demand-providing-broadest-software-1875394.htm this was a key observation as NPI did some creative analysis ?\tFlexera doesn?t publish a list price but NPI has two sets of price lists.  One from a detailed GSA document in 2012 and some abbreviated pricing from a client?s 2014 offer.  One key observation was it appeared that Flexera had some HUGE price increases between 2012 and 2014.  NPI decided to use our view of 2014 list pricing to analyze your current pricing.  This fits because you executed your current deal around that time. ?\tTo note again, we don?t have Cloud list pricing now or from 2014.  Flexera has a number of tiers based on volume for all the perpetual licenses. o\tThere?s a number of ways to cut it but from a perpetual license POV for these volumes I estimate the list price for the Platform and one connector (of which you have 62,500) is $18.50.  o\tAt these volumes we?d expect a discount near 40% for a net price of around $11.   o\tThere?s likely five ways to think about how you can compare a perpetual license cost to a Cloud option.  For example with Splunk if a perpetual license costs $100, then a term license is 40% of that or $40 and a Cloud license is 1.33 times that or about $53.  So the Cloud works out to 50% of the perpetual cost.  The inflection point is often at 2.5-3.5 years where the TCOs intersect.  Perpetual will have annual support as well. o\tTo simplify, if the net target for the perpetual license is $11 then if that?s 2.5 the cost of a Cloud option the target would be $4.50.   o\tMetLife?s current contract works out to $11.80. That?s the $2.95M all-in total which is $737.5K a year divided by 62,500. o\tIf you allow for a bit lower discounts since Cloud usually experiences that vs. perpetual, and if I round up wherever I could in my analysis then maybe I end up at $7-8. ?\tIn sum, I don?t have a perfect benchmark for the cost of Cloud FlexNet Manager Suite at your volumes but using the data at hand and analyzing a perpetual license purchase and using a reasonable conversion approach I conclude there?s a good amount of room to improve this price as you seek a global footprint. ?\tConsider asking them for a quote with list pricing for both perpetual and Cloud.  Let them know you are aware there are significant reductions to list price based on tiers and review those.   In perpetual license model the tiers at the high end have been 50000-74999; 75000-99999; 100000-149999; 150000-199999; 200000-249999 and they keep going.  Sometime we don?t see tiers with Cloud but if you surface your knowledge of tiers with perpetual licenses then you can raise the expectation that as Cloud tiers increase the price should go down.  In the high volumes each tier has a 3-8% drop in the respective list price.  Can talk you through this more but this should get the general message across.    Jim shared this vendor message: Jim,  Spoke to my management team.  Went through the normal questions around why the contractually agreed upon rate wasn?t good for this final year add-on.  What I can offer amounts to 9% additional discount for the 15k endpoints with a confirmation it will close by EOY.  Budgetary Estimate:  Contractually ? 15k endpoints for one year at $11.80 or $177,700 Concession for EOY - 15k endpoints for one year at $10.74 or $161,100  Know this is not what you were looking for yet what I could get approved.  and then Jim said: \"FYI.. don?t think I will be able to further reduce the fees.\"",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed BNYM?s 3-year offer from GitLab and found pricing to be above fair market value (FMV) for the combined spend.  BNYM?s demand is significant, as the vendor does not have an excessive amount of accounts with 10,000 or more users, and especially not many of those under a 3-year commitment.  GitLab has decent margins on this product even if support call volumes are high, and the long-term agreement would see good incentives passed to the sales team.  The vendor appears to be pushing hard for a decision on this agreement before their fiscal quarter end this month, and terms indicate that this includes a full prepayment of the term.  Even with a limited timeline for negotiations, NPI recommends BNYM create doubt in the sales team?s mind that this deal can proceed in its current form.  NPI sees the DevOps market as fiercely competitive at the moment, and if GitLab?s deal team believes the deal?s health is in question, they will bring their case before the executives in the sales organization for consideration.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI recommends focusing messaging on a $4.0M even target presented to GitLab as the level at which BNYM can maintain the current deal timeline.   ?\tNPI highly recommends not mentioning specific discount amounts or benchmarking tied to this deal at all, and instead focus GitLab on the larger annual and full-term costs.  If the GitLab sales team hears messaging that requests specific discounts, their internal systems often interpret this as a ?buy? signal and prevent them from authorizing further concessions.  Conversations focused on net and per user costs do not trigger these alerts, and NPI sees a much greater degree of success when that tract is followed without mentioning discount amounts.",

        "current_narrative": "No financials because this was a review of 3-vendors....   Hi Lucy,  Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.   I can appreciate the urgency and we tried to get you some information as quickly as we can.  We get a number of requests from Intuit and based on NPI?s contract with Intuit, our turnaround times are typically 4 to 5 business days.  We always strive to respond quicker, but 4 to 5 days is where most reviews will end up.  If we get too many urgent requests that jump the line, it can affect the turnaround times on other reviews we are doing for Intuit and other clients.  For future reviews, it would be best to prepare for a 4 - 5 day turnaround time for feedback from NPI.  This is a bit different than the type of reviews NPI typically does.  Intuit is seeking guidance to subscribe to licensing as an MSP or distributor, rather than as the consumer of a product or service themselves. While this is not the 1st time that we have done such a review for Intuit, and specifically for one of these three vendors, Symantec, this is not a type of transaction that we see often.  We have looked at this review in terms of the pure numbers, but the pricing model may be slightly different, so Intuit should keep that in mind as you review the information below.  Almost a year ago, Intuit asked NPI to review a renewal of Quick Online Backup Services. At that time, Intuit was comparing numerous vendors, including Symantec, for the sole purpose of Intuit buying online backup service wholesale from Norton (Symantec) and selling it to users of Intuit Online.   At the time, NPI offered Intuit the following advice, beyond the hard data surrounding market information on storage pricing:     Fast forward to this moment in time and again Norton (Symantec) is in the mix, this time pitted against Bitdefender and McAfee. While Bitdefender has been in business for 15 years, they have not had much success penetrating NPI?s client base and NPI has relatively small data by comparison to our Symantec and McAfee experience.  NPI was a bit surprised by McAfee?s attempt by to bolster their proposal with 5 pages of data that is all immediately accessible on their website:     In fact, the only truly compelling information provided, unless Intuit is strongly considering becoming a reseller or distributor for McAfee, is found on page 7. On page 7, we find the pricing information that shows that the offer from McAfee, based on a one year model represents an 89% discount from their MSRP for a single instance of their software. The 3 year annually paid offer improves this position to 91% off of MSRP and finally the 3 year pre-paid offer is almost 94% off of MSRP.  Comparing these price points from Symantec and McAfee, to those of the MSP model Bitdefender proposal, we find a mixed bag of higher and lower positions, based on time committed to and consumed licenses.  Both the offers from Bitdefender and McAfee appear to be far more competitively priced by comparison to the Symantec offer at a minimum of $13.99 per subscription, however, Symantec already has a presence within Intuit and Intuit?s Quickbook offering and, as such is probably expected to perform more favorably. At an 86% discount from list, Symantec?s discount is aggressive, but if compared to similarly sized transactions from Symantec, it falls a bit short of the 94% best-in-class discounting that NPI has seen in the past. If we take the simplest of views, NPI could apply the 100K licensing model to Symantec?s pricing, and produce a list price of $9.99M and a discounted price of $1.39M, or 86%. The target discount of 94% would result in net price of $600,000 or a reduction of almost $700K and furthermore, would bring the per license costs in-line with the other two provider proposals.",

        "current_narrative": "See email attached for cleaner view of feedback:  Hi Johan,  Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  We have seen a number of Checkmarx deals, in fact, we?ve seen a few from Intuit, so we know that Intuit has spent a few million dollars with Checkmarx over the past couple of years.  In our write-up below, you will see that NPI believes this pricing is ABOVE Fair Market Value (FMV) based on a) projected usage and, b) Intuit?s overall spend with Checkmarx over the past 12 ? 24 months.  It is difficult to benchmark this Codebashing quote because all of Codebashing?s developer modules are available to every developer, so the true market value will depend heavily on the actual consumption of training modules.  ? The proposal from Checkmarx?s Codebashing is offering 4,500 users access to all lessons and languages for a discounted price of $133/user/year.  Currently, Codebashing offers a total of 164 modules over 9 different languages (as per their website), effectively placing the annual cost per module at $0.81/user/year. o While pricing at $0.81/user/year is certainly considered FMV, NPI recommends an internal review as to the realistic expectations of actual consumption.   ? On average, there are ~22 courses for each of the 9 programming languages.   ? If developers focus their coding to a smaller subset of the offered programming languages, will the developers complete the training modules for languages they do not focus on?  Is the realistic consumption of the modules at 100%, 80%, 20%?  Actual consumption will potentially drive cost/user significantly higher (and likely above FMV). o Due to our believe that actual consumption will be significantly lower than 100%, NPI considers the pricing in this quote to be ABOVE (FMV). ? NPI suggests the creation of a matrix, similar to the sample below, be used as a negotiating data point as to why Intuit pricing overall needs to be further reduced.  The two primary variables that will need to be researched by Intuit are the developer #s and estimated use by each developer.  SAMPLE Projection of Value           Language # of Courses Developer #s List Price/Module List Per Language Price Est. Use Adj. List Price Java 22 3500 $ 2.13  $ 164,010  40% $65,604  .net 22 1000 $ 2.13  $ 46,860  40% $18,744  php 22 3000 $ 2.13  $ 140,580  40% $56,232  node.js 22 2500 $ 2.13  $ 117,150  40% $46,860  Ruby on Rails 22 2500 $ 2.13  $ 117,150  40% $46,860  Python 22 3000 $ 2.13  $ 140,580  40% $56,232  C++ 16 1000 $ 2.13  $ 34,080  40% $13,632  Android 8 1200 $ 2.13  $ 20,448  40% $8,179  iOS 8 1400 $ 2.13  $ 23,856  40% $9,542  Total 164   $ 804,714   $321,886         ? Once Intuit has calculated the Adjusted List Price, remember it is just that? LIST price, and a nominal 15% - 25% reduction should still be applied to that adjusted LIST price. ? NPI expects that there will be a number of developers that are well-versed in multiple languages.  We recommend that Intuit recognize that developer ?burn-out? is likely if they are asked to review modules from multiple categories.  This argument can be used to defend the lower estimated use figure. ? Checkmarx will typically offer deeper discounts to get the total contract pricing closer to the projected pricing that reflects Intuit?s calculations.",

        "current_narrative": "Continued from deal: 36602, several related docs in that deal.  Feedback was high-level.. didn't really recommend savings:  Thanks for letting NPI review this and provide feedback.  Overall, NPI considers the pricing on these NEW devices to be within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV).  We recommend that Springfield should consider refurbished equipment because it would be priced significantly lower and in this market, refurbished equipment often comes with the same warranties, etc.  Attached is a spreadsheet comparing 2 quotes for 2 different sites from 2 vendors, Consolidated and ConvergeOne. It appears both represent upgrades to R7.x CM's, with multiple Gateway sites remote to each Core.  Consolidated has 10, Springfield has 8.  Both sites are adding 600 9608 sets to each location, several port cards for end users and T'1's. It appears that the Springfield site had a co-term support contract quote for SA, while the Mattoon site has a 3 year annual SA UA quote.  We attempted to line up like for like material codes, or similar codes based on the target support outcome, so when you look at SS you will see side by side. We ignored a few small items like cables etc.  Additional Notes: 1.\tThere are minor price differences between the vendors, however, if the intent is to choose one vendor for both sites, we recommend that Springfield get quotes for each site from both vendors, including installation, support, upgrade protection. 2.\tSpringfield will want to require the same Project manager for both sites, and if appropriate an SPOC on the client end. Really a pain to deal with different PM's, waste a lot of time reviewing. 3.\tRequire a test plan for failover testing out of hours for GW site 4.\tVerify VMware software compatibility with the Avaya load, should have been tested; so trust but verify. 5.\tAsk for references for similar upgrades, paying particular attention to the Gateway sites. Not a recommendation, I know from personal experience C1 has a track record for this kind of upgrade. 6.\tIt was mentioned that Springfield intends to have a spare 8300 processor to use as you upgrade the individual sites....that works very well, saves a lot of time and hassle. 7.\tOn both designs , Springfield should look at refurbished pricing for the MM circuit cards. Quote totals are about $7700 for the 5 cards. We believe these can get the total below $4000 refurbished cards are available.  C1 will offer a one year warranty. On the phone sets it looks like C1 is offering a 3 year warranty on the 9608's. As you can see from the totals, there is very little difference in pricing.  C1 install costs are higher, but other costs offset the difference, however, support costs are only 8 months, while the Consolidated quote represents annual costs for 12 months. On Avaya proposals, TCO is greatly affected by support and upgrade costs, so this would give the slightest edge to the Consolidated pricing.",

        "current_narrative": "We reviewed the NS1 (Managed DNS) proposal from Intuit and here is our feedback: ?\tManaged DNS providers offer similar services, yet offerings are all slightly different and the structural buildout of Intuit?s infrastructure may typically overcome any shortcomings (if any) from the various providers. ?\tNPI performed a high-level review of how NS1 compares in key measurement metrics for a DNS Managed Services provider at www.dnsperf.com and finds no problematic issues of concern.  NPI recommends that Intuit periodically review measurement sites to ensure company performance is functioning at expectations. ?\tNS1 offering allows for 10B queries / month for $17,500/year or $1,458/mo.  At this price point, the cost/M querries is $0.14583.  NPI finds this pricing to be at Fair Market Value (FMV). ?\tNSONE or NS1 is a provider of intelligent DNS and traffic management services. The company is headquartered in New York, and has offices in San Francisco and in Singapore. Founded in 2013 by a team with first-hand experience in building content delivery networks (CDNs), infrastructure APIs and cloud platforms, NSONE came about to enable and improve present day?s dynamic infrastructures. ?\tNS1 leverages infrastructure, network and real time user data to allow customers on their platform to create customized routing setups for a wide variety of applications. They offer data driven traffic management, managed DNS and dedicated DNS. Their product Pulsar is designed for real-time performance-based traffic routing, and offers fully automated traffic management functionality that can be used in a multi-CDN solution. ?\tNPI?s enterprise clients will typically have two DNS providers to ensure a high availability network design.  And the previously reviewed Verisign analysis for Intuit in December 2016 is in line with this dual vendor strategy for Managed DNS services.",

        "current_narrative": "Clarification email back and her answers:  Hi Meaghan, Sorry for my delayed response.  My key Jive analyst has been out this week and it took me a little effort to think about my reply.  This may be a tough one to review but let?s dig in a bit first.  When you say Jive 8 that tells me you?re one version behind the latest Jive 9 release.  That?s not uncommon for clients with perpetual licenses especially if you have a number of customizations that can be tough to upgrade.  That leads to several questions that I?ll note below.  I understand Intel can?t share your vendor contracts but the general understanding is you?d make a best effort at still providing enough detail on your commercial arrangement to allow NPI to provide a benchmark.  Our focus is generally around evaluating actual offered pricing and less around trying to come up with an expected scenario for a price.  Sometimes this is because vendors don?t publish a list price (that?s the case with Jive) or there?s so many feature and ways Jive can package up their offering that NPI can?t accurately perform that task but our database is set up to analyze an actual offer.  Here's some questions that will allow NPI to determine if we can provide a benchmark. ?\tWhat Product(s) from Jive are you using?  They?ve changed names quite a bit and now call their Internal Collaboration product Jive-n and their external one Jive-x for customers and partners.  o\tI believe Jive-n now has Select, Premier and Premier + plans.  We are using Jive-n and have a Platinum plan o\tJive-x has Basic and Advanced Packages  o\tNPI would need to know this granular detail about your products. ?\tWhile they often say the number of licensed users is UNLIMITED in reality there?s typically an Authorized number of users.  Please share that for each product. Unlimited, truly ?\tWhat?s the current run rate for each product?  I?m assuming you bought perpetual licenses and your recurring expense is Software Support.  Please confirm.  Knowing the original license price can also be helpful because with any upgrade it?s not just about the benchmark as there?s the art of the deal and how are they compensating you (if at all) for past license purchases. We renew annually for the license and support is included ?\tHow long have you had each Product?  5 years ?\tAre you considering a 3 year term in the Cloud? We would like to have a 1 yr agreement, potential for more if a large enough discount ?\tWhy are you changing?  This adds a dynamic to your pricing as you convert.  For example, is Intel?s board forcing a switch to the cloud across the enterprise?  Is there a defined business criteria?  Is Jive forcing this?  The reasons can determine leverage points and expected pricing flexibility.  If it is being forced upon Intel then it really is all about price.  If it is to obtain different features or not continue to battle keeping customizations when you upgrade then there?s more about payback and value.  Intel has an overall move to cloud strategy.  We would also like the new features that come with the cloud version with minimal internal IT support ?\tIs this a like for like move? Yes, would expect the same services/support after the move ?\tWhat are Intel?s Use Cases for either/or the Internal or External products?  What sort of communities do you have set up? We have 3 major classes of communities: Existing organizational units, Project teams, & Social interaction communities ?\tWhat are the cost elements offered for the transition? Services? New SaaS cost?  You should expect to pay more for SaaS than you have been for ongoing software support renewals.  Better services, less internal cost to Intel to maintain/update servers  I know this is a number of items but in the absence of seeing actually contracts this is the information required to make an NPI benchmark possible and worthwhile to Intel.  Felt had enough to say to agree to FMV.",

        "current_narrative": "No financials because this was a review of 3-vendors....   Hi Lucy,  Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.   I can appreciate the urgency and we tried to get you some information as quickly as we can.  We get a number of requests from Intuit and based on NPI?s contract with Intuit, our turnaround times are typically 4 to 5 business days.  We always strive to respond quicker, but 4 to 5 days is where most reviews will end up.  If we get too many urgent requests that jump the line, it can affect the turnaround times on other reviews we are doing for Intuit and other clients.  For future reviews, it would be best to prepare for a 4 - 5 day turnaround time for feedback from NPI.  This is a bit different than the type of reviews NPI typically does.  Intuit is seeking guidance to subscribe to licensing as an MSP or distributor, rather than as the consumer of a product or service themselves. While this is not the 1st time that we have done such a review for Intuit, and specifically for one of these three vendors, Symantec, this is not a type of transaction that we see often.  We have looked at this review in terms of the pure numbers, but the pricing model may be slightly different, so Intuit should keep that in mind as you review the information below.  Almost a year ago, Intuit asked NPI to review a renewal of Quick Online Backup Services. At that time, Intuit was comparing numerous vendors, including Symantec, for the sole purpose of Intuit buying online backup service wholesale from Norton (Symantec) and selling it to users of Intuit Online.   At the time, NPI offered Intuit the following advice, beyond the hard data surrounding market information on storage pricing:     Fast forward to this moment in time and again Norton (Symantec) is in the mix, this time pitted against Bitdefender and McAfee. While Bitdefender has been in business for 15 years, they have not had much success penetrating NPI?s client base and NPI has relatively small data by comparison to our Symantec and McAfee experience.  NPI was a bit surprised by McAfee?s attempt by to bolster their proposal with 5 pages of data that is all immediately accessible on their website:     In fact, the only truly compelling information provided, unless Intuit is strongly considering becoming a reseller or distributor for McAfee, is found on page 7. On page 7, we find the pricing information that shows that the offer from McAfee, based on a one year model represents an 89% discount from their MSRP for a single instance of their software. The 3 year annually paid offer improves this position to 91% off of MSRP and finally the 3 year pre-paid offer is almost 94% off of MSRP.  Comparing these price points from Symantec and McAfee, to those of the MSP model Bitdefender proposal, we find a mixed bag of higher and lower positions, based on time committed to and consumed licenses.  Both the offers from Bitdefender and McAfee appear to be far more competitively priced by comparison to the Symantec offer at a minimum of $13.99 per subscription, however, Symantec already has a presence within Intuit and Intuit?s Quickbook offering and, as such is probably expected to perform more favorably. At an 86% discount from list, Symantec?s discount is aggressive, but if compared to similarly sized transactions from Symantec, it falls a bit short of the 94% best-in-class discounting that NPI has seen in the past. If we take the simplest of views, NPI could apply the 100K licensing model to Symantec?s pricing, and produce a list price of $9.99M and a discounted price of $1.39M, or 86%. The target discount of 94% would result in net price of $600,000 or a reduction of almost $700K and furthermore, would bring the per license costs in-line with the other two provider proposals.",

        "current_narrative": "Pricing Analysis ?\tNPI combined both proposals to provide a consolidated view of the Brocade hardware renewal.    SEE FMV for details.  The NPI analysis of the Brocade proposals finds the various discounting on the models to be unusual for a Brocade renewal.   The majority of the HW in this renewal is less than 5 years old as stated by Morgan Stanley.  As HW increases in age, hardware manufacturers will often begin a steady increase in maintenance costs to ?encourage? a hardware refresh.    Data shows the typical 5% Y/Y increase on many of the items yet tied to the unusual discounting, NPI is also seeing some unusual increases and decreases (which appear to be tied to a reduction in support levels). It makes for a lot of moving parts year over year.  NPI calculated a blended discount rate of 30.9% and finds discount to be below our FMV range.  NPI will often see discounts in the 40% - 45% range for renewals near the $1M range.  NPI does not see any particular rationale as to why discounting should vary between hardware models and recommends a FMV target of a straight 47% on all SKUs.  In this exercise, NPI actually reduced discounts on some SKUs (that NPI believed to be unusually high) to the same 47%.  Achieving this target will result in a savings of $180K.  The FMV target of 47% on all renewal SKUs would be considered ?best-in-classs? pricing.  NPI is targeting this level of pricing because of the potential sales opportunities that MS is considering in the near future.  Premier Onsite Support Engineer (OSE) is currently discounted at 33%.  NPI targets $192,000 or a 40% discount as FMV.  This FMV target will land the OSE at $96/hr.   Achieving this target will result in $24,000 in additional savings.

        "current_narrative": "See email attached for cleaner view of feedback:  Hi Johan,  Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  We have seen a number of Checkmarx deals, in fact, we?ve seen a few from Intuit, so we know that Intuit has spent a few million dollars with Checkmarx over the past couple of years.  In our write-up below, you will see that NPI believes this pricing is ABOVE Fair Market Value (FMV) based on a) projected usage and, b) Intuit?s overall spend with Checkmarx over the past 12 ? 24 months.  It is difficult to benchmark this Codebashing quote because all of Codebashing?s developer modules are available to every developer, so the true market value will depend heavily on the actual consumption of training modules.  ? The proposal from Checkmarx?s Codebashing is offering 4,500 users access to all lessons and languages for a discounted price of $133/user/year.  Currently, Codebashing offers a total of 164 modules over 9 different languages (as per their website), effectively placing the annual cost per module at $0.81/user/year. o While pricing at $0.81/user/year is certainly considered FMV, NPI recommends an internal review as to the realistic expectations of actual consumption.   ? On average, there are ~22 courses for each of the 9 programming languages.   ? If developers focus their coding to a smaller subset of the offered programming languages, will the developers complete the training modules for languages they do not focus on?  Is the realistic consumption of the modules at 100%, 80%, 20%?  Actual consumption will potentially drive cost/user significantly higher (and likely above FMV). o Due to our believe that actual consumption will be significantly lower than 100%, NPI considers the pricing in this quote to be ABOVE (FMV). ? NPI suggests the creation of a matrix, similar to the sample below, be used as a negotiating data point as to why Intuit pricing overall needs to be further reduced.  The two primary variables that will need to be researched by Intuit are the developer #s and estimated use by each developer.  SAMPLE Projection of Value           Language # of Courses Developer #s List Price/Module List Per Language Price Est. Use Adj. List Price Java 22 3500 $ 2.13  $ 164,010  40% $65,604  .net 22 1000 $ 2.13  $ 46,860  40% $18,744  php 22 3000 $ 2.13  $ 140,580  40% $56,232  node.js 22 2500 $ 2.13  $ 117,150  40% $46,860  Ruby on Rails 22 2500 $ 2.13  $ 117,150  40% $46,860  Python 22 3000 $ 2.13  $ 140,580  40% $56,232  C++ 16 1000 $ 2.13  $ 34,080  40% $13,632  Android 8 1200 $ 2.13  $ 20,448  40% $8,179  iOS 8 1400 $ 2.13  $ 23,856  40% $9,542  Total 164   $ 804,714   $321,886         ? Once Intuit has calculated the Adjusted List Price, remember it is just that? LIST price, and a nominal 15% - 25% reduction should still be applied to that adjusted LIST price. ? NPI expects that there will be a number of developers that are well-versed in multiple languages.  We recommend that Intuit recognize that developer ?burn-out? is likely if they are asked to review modules from multiple categories.  This argument can be used to defend the lower estimated use figure. ? Checkmarx will typically offer deeper discounts to get the total contract pricing closer to the projected pricing that reflects Intuit?s calculations.",

Feedback was high-level.. didn't really recommend savings:  Thanks for letting NPI review this and provide feedback.  Overall, NPI considers the pricing on these NEW devices to be within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV).  We recommend that Springfield should consider refurbished equipment because it would be priced significantly lower and in this market, refurbished equipment often comes with the same warranties, etc.  Attached is a spreadsheet comparing 2 quotes for 2 different sites from 2 vendors, Consolidated and ConvergeOne. It appears both represent upgrades to R7.x CM's, with multiple Gateway sites remote to each Core.  Consolidated has 10, Springfield has 8.  Both sites are adding 600 9608 sets to each location, several port cards for end users and T'1's. It appears that the Springfield site had a co-term support contract quote for SA, while the Mattoon site has a 3 year annual SA UA quote.  We attempted to line up like for like material codes, or similar codes based on the target support outcome, so when you look at SS you will see side by side. We ignored a few small items like cables etc.  Additional Notes: 1.\tThere are minor price differences between the vendors, however, if the intent is to choose one vendor for both sites, we recommend that Springfield get quotes for each site from both vendors, including installation, support, upgrade protection. 2.\tSpringfield will want to require the same Project manager for both sites, and if appropriate an SPOC on the client end. Really a pain to deal with different PM's, waste a lot of time reviewing. 3.\tRequire a test plan for failover testing out of hours for GW site 4.\tVerify VMware software compatibility with the Avaya load, should have been tested; so trust but verify. 5.\tAsk for references for similar upgrades, paying particular attention to the Gateway sites. Not a recommendation, I know from personal experience C1 has a track record for this kind of upgrade. 6.\tIt was mentioned that Springfield intends to have a spare 8300 processor to use as you upgrade the individual sites....that works very well, saves a lot of time and hassle. 7.\tOn both designs , Springfield should look at refurbished pricing for the MM circuit cards. Quote totals are about $7700 for the 5 cards. We believe these can get the total below $4000 refurbished cards are available.  C1 will offer a one year warranty. On the phone sets it looks like C1 is offering a 3 year warranty on the 9608's. As you can see from the totals, there is very little difference in pricing.  C1 install costs are higher, but other costs offset the difference, however, support costs are only 8 months, while the Consolidated quote represents annual costs for 12 months. On Avaya proposals, TCO is greatly affected by support and upgrade costs, so this would give the slightest edge to the Consolidated pricing.",

Paperwork in finalized state.  2/16/18 - call with Grace, John, Chad to discuss MSFT's unwillingness to provide deal discount to true up table and future pricing.  NPI advice to hold firm, fall back to as -is if needed.  2/9/18- CTM received with custom language that allows downgrades of older versions for Office and specifically says customer will not deploy click to run.   Client received updated CPSs 2/8/18 and called to review.  We've returned calls and sent advice via email but have not heard from them as of the end of the day 2/8/18. 2/2/18 - client is receiving updated paperwork and language today/tomorrow.  They will let us know if they need anything else.  1/26/18 - AmierHealth legal is still awaiting response from MSFT legal regarding downgrade language.  1/19/18 - no update this week.  1/12/18 - sent email to client to advise that we make it clear to MSFT that delay in getting deal completed is due to MSFT's silence on request for final docs.   (language amendment and final CPS) 1/4/18 - client (Grace) called today to update NPI.  AmeriHealth trued up all call center employees and is going with MSFT Option 2 (one profile M365 E3 from SA).  Client is engaging internal counsel on language - this is a must for this deal to close.  Otherwise we will push for \"AS IS\".   12/29/17 - status call with client 12/29.   Awaiting MSFT decision on downgrade amendment.  BATNA is As-Is.  12/22/17 - client's MDO is M365E3 - working on getting SCE and EA to 3.3m per year.  Still need downgrade language .  Will elect full M365 E3 full USL for contractors.  12/8/17 -started more frequent  coaching sessions with client to discuss upcoming negotiations.  Client has 3 quotes - 0% as is, 7% M365 E3 and 14%-31% on M365E5.   12/1/17 - updated quotes due today.   Client is making nice progress on product decisions/reductions/migrations to EA from Select Plus.  John Nguygen agreed to talk to Chad Goodwin re: MA.  11/22/17 - checked in with client to get updated quotes from MSFT.  Client postponed meeting with them until we have these docs.  Meeting scheduled on 11/30 to discuss Server model change and proc to core results.  11/17/17 - Met with client to review project, plan, discuss MDO and request to MSFT for updated quotes and to review negotiation tactics for meeting with MSFT next week.  M365E3 is desired solution! Quote promised from MSFT today.  11/10/17 - met with client this week to discuss request for quotes and true up.   Client is making good progress on technical decisions although have not shared their ultimate MDO with us yet.   We are getting closer.  Still need VS information.  11/2/17 - client meeting with MSFT week of 11/6 and reviewing ME3/E5 and OE3/E5 solutions.  Still need Visual Studio details and another meeting to review Windows Server proc to core transition.  10/26/17 - Windows server details received on 10/25 and additional O365 meeting to be held afternoon of 10/26,  10/20/17 - onsite today for initial F&R.  10/13/17 - client has been sent MA but not agreed to it yet.  Plan to send 2 MPSA models to client to see options vs. renewing EA.  On site F&R scheduled on 10/20.  10/5/17 -call to discuss SAM was held on 10/5/17 and at client's request, status meeting to happen 10/6/17.  No new updates on counts or profiles, MDO, LAA, BATNA.  9/29/17 - client has new consultant on status calls, Dino, who formerly worked for them in IT and knows the rounds on MSFT.  Dino wanted NPI to perform SAM on MAP data (said it's 35 spreadsheets with 10s of 1000s or rows of raw data, there has been no hygeine on data, no correct allocation or assignment of licenses and no capturing of inactive users/devices).  Net is that this client doesn't think they will have numbers for us within the project term. Once dates provided by client, Cindy/Joshua to determine best time to go in person to \"work through\" F&R together with client.  9/21/17 - customer is working to finalize counts.  Windows Server information provided 9/20.  We are also working to set the baseline for MA.  8/31/17 - customer has new info on Citrix/RDS.  Working on new user counts/devices.   8/25/18 - client received MSFT quote on 8/24 - we are in process of reviewing.  Part 3 of infrastructure meeting on 8/28.  8/18/17 - held part one of infrastructure call this week, part 2 on Monday 8/21.  Wrote ghost written letter requesting quote from MSFT. 8/10/17 - new quotes received since last week.  Review of these is in process.  NPI setting up meeting with IT mgr responsible for Citrix to review environment and ensure licensing is correct.  SHI sent 3 year EA quotes vs. annual pricing and at LEVEL A!  Still need to talk through their basket of goods so we can  model out their most desired outcome.  8/4/17 - Joshua sent RDS/Citrix details to John/Stephen.  We are still awaiting quote - will follow up today if still no word.  7/28/17 - client received completely incorrect quote from SHI .  LSP quoted Select Plus. We will develop an MA. 3 years remaining.  Cindy advised going back and requesting correction as line items referenced \"select plus\".  AmeriHealth found out from LSP that they no longer qualifyt for Level D pricing as MSFT will no longer allow their inclusion in the \"association\".  Need to understand this - likely the shake up of the healthcare vertical with MSFT internally is causing this.  It's also possible that they are getting a new account team - this is just speculation, but we can use this to help negotiation as well.  Client wants info on deployment of SQL subscriptions on SCE as potential licensing model for Performacare.  Cindy following up and initially believes this should be similar to EAS licensing and capable of on-prem deployment.  Client sent Citrix question to Josh on RDS - Cindy/Joshua to review.  7/21/17 - client has requested specific SQL modeling for an affiliate that was \"missed\" at last true up.  Wants all options - SQL is covered product family in SCE.   We review SCE including subscription.  7/14/17 - had status meeting on 7/13/17.  Client wants further analysis of options to license SQL cores on a majority owned affiliate, PerformCare  that hasn't been covered in SCE previously..  Client requested as is quotes from MSFT and is looking into MSDN oversubcriptions. Client will also be sending details on licensing requirements for virtualized apps on Large Citrix implementation. 7/7/17 - sent ghostwritten message to client for request of as-is quotes.   6/30 - Discovery meeting attended by John, Stephen and Anthony, which was a lighter audience than expected, but had very good dialogue and ran way over time. 6/23 - Confusion around the Discovery meeting, slated for next week now, however still awaiting final server information. 6/16: discovery mtg 6/29 - awaiting details fro client so we can perform calcs and analysis. 6/01/17 - Completed interviews and received final documents.  Still need final server numbers for Windows/Systems Center for Discovery Report and initial 'As Is' estimate and working to schedule Discovery meeting. 5/12/2017 - Same as last week, no material progress as of yet. 5/5/2017 - Had bi-weekly call and discussed project timeline, questionnaire deadline and next steps.  Also lots of Q&A and coaching on preparation. 4/28:  Client happy. Meeting was a waste.  Really wanted a meet and greet with the team.  Better to have tied it to a deliverable event.  4/21:  On-site on Tuesday for strategy discussion and planning the approach to MSFT.  4/7:  Surprised that their executive was trying to close 9 mos. before expiration.  Trying to delay on-site so not to disrupt other deals. 3/31:  Held kickoff.  Good start, especially with John Ng.  3/24:  Kickoff next week.  3/17/2017 - Official kickoff being scheduled for next week or the week after. 3/10/2017 - No major update to report, working on kickoff date once John is back. 3/3/17 - Drafted project plan for John Nguyen, hoping to have kickoff next week or week after.",

        "description": "Msft EA Renewal, part of subscription.  We spent near a year working on Discovery, with many options and and a lot of planning.  We even uncovered numerous non-compliant situations and provided specific advice on how to rectify.  The customer was very interested in O365 as a potential option, but getting the right discount and pricing was very important.  Of course, they were very concerned with security as well, but once they got past that concern it was a solid decision to move forward with an O365 option.  Unfortunately Grace was waiting in the wings to take over and pull NPI out for the final rounds.  She was frustrated with MSFT's resistance to her strategy, but her boss ended up coming back to us, along with John Ngyuen, and seeking our advice and benchmarking for the final rounds.  Ultimately they got a good deal, it could have been better if they would have followed our advice, but as we found out, Grace wanted to discontinue our relationship and even went as far as to say that they know as much as NPI and don't need any of our benchmarking any longer.  Also that they are premier negotiators now.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Kronos and found the pricing for the core SaaS bundle to be above Fair Market Value (FMV) with room for improvement of up to 24% based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the other add-on software subscriptions are at FMV.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions. ?\tThe core SaaS bundle is priced at $2.74 per employee, per month (PEPM). The list pricing for this bundle is $7 PEPM, which is an increase from the previous list price of $5 PEPM.  o\tFor 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $1.82 PEPM. This translates to savings of $13,800 per month. ?\tThe Workforce Activities software is priced at $0.45 PEPM. This price is at Fair Market Value (FMV). ?\tThe Workforce Accruals software is priced at $0.26, which is also at FMV. ?\t The Workforce Record Manager is priced at $0.15. For 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $0.11 PEPM. This translates to savings of $600 per month. ?\tWF Analytics is priced at $0.86 PEPM. This price is FMV. ?\tThe overall savings based on NPI?s recommended target price translates to $14,400 per month and $358,560 for the 36-month period with a 24-month ramp up.  Other considerations: ?\tNPI has not seen Kronos insist on prepayment for the subscriptions. This is certainly negotiable. ?\tHowever, NPI has also not seen Kronos concede to a ramp up pricing, which reduces the revenue in years 1 and 2.  o\tMost SaaS vendors prefer an even annual or front-loaded pricing/revenue model and a 3-5 year commitment.  A ramp up licensing scenario inevitably results in higher pricing per license for the customer and higher TCO over 5 years. However, if a customer has strong leverage (for example, if the customer already has perpetual licenses and does not need the licenses since they don?t require upgrades, and therefore would not be likely to make the purchase at all, or if there is competition in the mix), the vendor will concede to these terms. ?\tA target of $2 per employee per month for Time and Accruals for 15,000 employees is achievable. The motivation by Kronos to provide a larger incentive for a large employee base is in line with their marketing approach, which highly touts the number of users/employees that use or are managed through KRONOS cloud. ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially on the add-on subscriptions.",

        "current_narrative": "See email attached for cleaner view of feedback:  Hi Johan,  Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  We have seen a number of Checkmarx deals, in fact, we?ve seen a few from Intuit, so we know that Intuit has spent a few million dollars with Checkmarx over the past couple of years.  In our write-up below, you will see that NPI believes this pricing is ABOVE Fair Market Value (FMV) based on a) projected usage and, b) Intuit?s overall spend with Checkmarx over the past 12 ? 24 months.  It is difficult to benchmark this Codebashing quote because all of Codebashing?s developer modules are available to every developer, so the true market value will depend heavily on the actual consumption of training modules.  ? The proposal from Checkmarx?s Codebashing is offering 4,500 users access to all lessons and languages for a discounted price of $133/user/year.  Currently, Codebashing offers a total of 164 modules over 9 different languages (as per their website), effectively placing the annual cost per module at $0.81/user/year. o While pricing at $0.81/user/year is certainly considered FMV, NPI recommends an internal review as to the realistic expectations of actual consumption.   ? On average, there are ~22 courses for each of the 9 programming languages.   ? If developers focus their coding to a smaller subset of the offered programming languages, will the developers complete the training modules for languages they do not focus on?  Is the realistic consumption of the modules at 100%, 80%, 20%?  Actual consumption will potentially drive cost/user significantly higher (and likely above FMV). o Due to our believe that actual consumption will be significantly lower than 100%, NPI considers the pricing in this quote to be ABOVE (FMV). ? NPI suggests the creation of a matrix, similar to the sample below, be used as a negotiating data point as to why Intuit pricing overall needs to be further reduced.  The two primary variables that will need to be researched by Intuit are the developer #s and estimated use by each developer.  SAMPLE Projection of Value           Language # of Courses Developer #s List Price/Module List Per Language Price Est. Use Adj. List Price Java 22 3500 $ 2.13  $ 164,010  40% $65,604  .net 22 1000 $ 2.13  $ 46,860  40% $18,744  php 22 3000 $ 2.13  $ 140,580  40% $56,232  node.js 22 2500 $ 2.13  $ 117,150  40% $46,860  Ruby on Rails 22 2500 $ 2.13  $ 117,150  40% $46,860  Python 22 3000 $ 2.13  $ 140,580  40% $56,232  C++ 16 1000 $ 2.13  $ 34,080  40% $13,632  Android 8 1200 $ 2.13  $ 20,448  40% $8,179  iOS 8 1400 $ 2.13  $ 23,856  40% $9,542  Total 164   $ 804,714   $321,886         ? Once Intuit has calculated the Adjusted List Price, remember it is just that? LIST price, and a nominal 15% - 25% reduction should still be applied to that adjusted LIST price. ? NPI expects that there will be a number of developers that are well-versed in multiple languages.  We recommend that Intuit recognize that developer ?burn-out? is likely if they are asked to review modules from multiple categories.  This argument can be used to defend the lower estimated use figure. ? Checkmarx will typically offer deeper discounts to get the total contract pricing closer to the projected pricing that reflects Intuit?s calculations.",

Feedback was high-level.. didn't really recommend savings:  Thanks for letting NPI review this and provide feedback.  Overall, NPI considers the pricing on these NEW devices to be within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV).  We recommend that Springfield should consider refurbished equipment because it would be priced significantly lower and in this market, refurbished equipment often comes with the same warranties, etc.  Attached is a spreadsheet comparing 2 quotes for 2 different sites from 2 vendors, Consolidated and ConvergeOne. It appears both represent upgrades to R7.x CM's, with multiple Gateway sites remote to each Core.  Consolidated has 10, Springfield has 8.  Both sites are adding 600 9608 sets to each location, several port cards for end users and T'1's. It appears that the Springfield site had a co-term support contract quote for SA, while the Mattoon site has a 3 year annual SA UA quote.  We attempted to line up like for like material codes, or similar codes based on the target support outcome, so when you look at SS you will see side by side. We ignored a few small items like cables etc.  Additional Notes: 1.\tThere are minor price differences between the vendors, however, if the intent is to choose one vendor for both sites, we recommend that Springfield get quotes for each site from both vendors, including installation, support, upgrade protection. 2.\tSpringfield will want to require the same Project manager for both sites, and if appropriate an SPOC on the client end. Really a pain to deal with different PM's, waste a lot of time reviewing. 3.\tRequire a test plan for failover testing out of hours for GW site 4.\tVerify VMware software compatibility with the Avaya load, should have been tested; so trust but verify. 5.\tAsk for references for similar upgrades, paying particular attention to the Gateway sites. Not a recommendation, I know from personal experience C1 has a track record for this kind of upgrade. 6.\tIt was mentioned that Springfield intends to have a spare 8300 processor to use as you upgrade the individual sites....that works very well, saves a lot of time and hassle. 7.\tOn both designs , Springfield should look at refurbished pricing for the MM circuit cards. Quote totals are about $7700 for the 5 cards. We believe these can get the total below $4000 refurbished cards are available.  C1 will offer a one year warranty. On the phone sets it looks like C1 is offering a 3 year warranty on the 9608's. As you can see from the totals, there is very little difference in pricing.  C1 install costs are higher, but other costs offset the difference, however, support costs are only 8 months, while the Consolidated quote represents annual costs for 12 months. On Avaya proposals, TCO is greatly affected by support and upgrade costs, so this would give the slightest edge to the Consolidated pricing.",

They will let us know if they need anything else.  1/26/18 - AmierHealth legal is still awaiting response from MSFT legal regarding downgrade language.  1/19/18 - no update this week.  1/12/18 - sent email to client to advise that we make it clear to MSFT that delay in getting deal completed is due to MSFT's silence on request for final docs.   (language amendment and final CPS) 1/4/18 - client (Grace) called today to update NPI.  AmeriHealth trued up all call center employees and is going with MSFT Option 2 (one profile M365 E3 from SA).  Client is engaging internal counsel on language - this is a must for this deal to close.  Otherwise we will push for \"AS IS\".   12/29/17 - status call with client 12/29.   Awaiting MSFT decision on downgrade amendment.  BATNA is As-Is.  12/22/17 - client's MDO is M365E3 - working on getting SCE and EA to 3.3m per year.  Still need downgrade language .  Will elect full M365 E3 full USL for contractors.  12/8/17 -started more frequent  coaching sessions with client to discuss upcoming negotiations.  Client has 3 quotes - 0% as is, 7% M365 E3 and 14%-31% on M365E5.   12/1/17 - updated quotes due today.   Client is making nice progress on product decisions/reductions/migrations to EA from Select Plus.  John Nguygen agreed to talk to Chad Goodwin re: MA.  11/22/17 - checked in with client to get updated quotes from MSFT.  Client postponed meeting with them until we have these docs.  Meeting scheduled on 11/30 to discuss Server model change and proc to core results.  11/17/17 - Met with client to review project, plan, discuss MDO and request to MSFT for updated quotes and to review negotiation tactics for meeting with MSFT next week.  M365E3 is desired solution! Quote promised from MSFT today.  11/10/17 - met with client this week to discuss request for quotes and true up.   Client is making good progress on technical decisions although have not shared their ultimate MDO with us yet.   We are getting closer.  Still need VS information.  11/2/17 - client meeting with MSFT week of 11/6 and reviewing ME3/E5 and OE3/E5 solutions.  Still need Visual Studio details and another meeting to review Windows Server proc to core transition.  10/26/17 - Windows server details received on 10/25 and additional O365 meeting to be held afternoon of 10/26,  10/20/17 - onsite today for initial F&R.  10/13/17 - client has been sent MA but not agreed to it yet.  Plan to send 2 MPSA models to client to see options vs. renewing EA.  On site F&R scheduled on 10/20.  10/5/17 -call to discuss SAM was held on 10/5/17 and at client's request, status meeting to happen 10/6/17.  No new updates on counts or profiles, MDO, LAA, BATNA.  9/29/17 - client has new consultant on status calls, Dino, who formerly worked for them in IT and knows the rounds on MSFT.  Dino wanted NPI to perform SAM on MAP data (said it's 35 spreadsheets with 10s of 1000s or rows of raw data, there has been no hygeine on data, no correct allocation or assignment of licenses and no capturing of inactive users/devices).  Net is that this client doesn't think they will have numbers for us within the project term. Once dates provided by client, Cindy/Joshua to determine best time to go in person to \"work through\" F&R together with client.  9/21/17 - customer is working to finalize counts.  Windows Server information provided 9/20.  We are also working to set the baseline for MA.  8/31/17 - customer has new info on Citrix/RDS.  Working on new user counts/devices.   8/25/18 - client received MSFT quote on 8/24 - we are in process of reviewing.  Part 3 of infrastructure meeting on 8/28.  8/18/17 - held part one of infrastructure call this week, part 2 on Monday 8/21.  Wrote ghost written letter requesting quote from MSFT. 8/10/17 - new quotes received since last week.  Review of these is in process.  NPI setting up meeting with IT mgr responsible for Citrix to review environment and ensure licensing is correct.  SHI sent 3 year EA quotes vs. annual pricing and at LEVEL A!  Still need to talk through their basket of goods so we can  model out their most desired outcome.  8/4/17 - Joshua sent RDS/Citrix details to John/Stephen.  We are still awaiting quote - will follow up today if still no word.  7/28/17 - client received completely incorrect quote from SHI .  LSP quoted Select Plus. We will develop an MA. 3 years remaining.  Cindy advised going back and requesting correction as line items referenced \"select plus\".  AmeriHealth found out from LSP that they no longer qualifyt for Level D pricing as MSFT will no longer allow their inclusion in the \"association\".  Need to understand this - likely the shake up of the healthcare vertical with MSFT internally is causing this.  It's also possible that they are getting a new account team - this is just speculation, but we can use this to help negotiation as well.  Client wants info on deployment of SQL subscriptions on SCE as potential licensing model for Performacare.  Cindy following up and initially believes this should be similar to EAS licensing and capable of on-prem deployment.  Client sent Citrix question to Josh on RDS - Cindy/Joshua to review.  7/21/17 - client has requested specific SQL modeling for an affiliate that was \"missed\" at last true up.  Wants all options - SQL is covered product family in SCE.   We review SCE including subscription.  7/14/17 - had status meeting on 7/13/17.  Client wants further analysis of options to license SQL cores on a majority owned affiliate, PerformCare  that hasn't been covered in SCE previously..  Client requested as is quotes from MSFT and is looking into MSDN oversubcriptions. Client will also be sending details on licensing requirements for virtualized apps on Large Citrix implementation. 7/7/17 - sent ghostwritten message to client for request of as-is quotes.   6/30 - Discovery meeting attended by John, Stephen and Anthony, which was a lighter audience than expected, but had very good dialogue and ran way over time. 6/23 - Confusion around the Discovery meeting, slated for next week now, however still awaiting final server information. 6/16: discovery mtg 6/29 - awaiting details fro client so we can perform calcs and analysis. 6/01/17 - Completed interviews and received final documents.  Still need final server numbers for Windows/Systems Center for Discovery Report and initial 'As Is' estimate and working to schedule Discovery meeting. 5/12/2017 - Same as last week, no material progress as of yet. 5/5/2017 - Had bi-weekly call and discussed project timeline, questionnaire deadline and next steps.  Also lots of Q&A and coaching on preparation. 4/28:  Client happy. Meeting was a waste.  Really wanted a meet and greet with the team.  Better to have tied it to a deliverable event.  4/21:  On-site on Tuesday for strategy discussion and planning the approach to MSFT.  4/7:  Surprised that their executive was trying to close 9 mos. before expiration.  Trying to delay on-site so not to disrupt other deals. 3/31:  Held kickoff.  Good start, especially with John Ng.  3/24:  Kickoff next week.  3/17/2017 - Official kickoff being scheduled for next week or the week after. 3/10/2017 - No major update to report, working on kickoff date once John is back. 3/3/17 - Drafted project plan for John Nguyen, hoping to have kickoff next week or week after.",

        "description": "Msft EA Renewal, part of subscription.  We spent near a year working on Discovery, with many options and and a lot of planning.  We even uncovered numerous non-compliant situations and provided specific advice on how to rectify.  The customer was very interested in O365 as a potential option, but getting the right discount and pricing was very important.  Of course, they were very concerned with security as well, but once they got past that concern it was a solid decision to move forward with an O365 option.  Unfortunately Grace was waiting in the wings to take over and pull NPI out for the final rounds.  She was frustrated with MSFT's resistance to her strategy, but her boss ended up coming back to us, along with John Ngyuen, and seeking our advice and benchmarking for the final rounds.  Ultimately they got a good deal, it could have been better if they would have followed our advice, but as we found out, Grace wanted to discontinue our relationship and even went as far as to say that they know as much as NPI and don't need any of our benchmarking any longer.  Also that they are premier negotiators now.",

The barrier to achieving savings here is that this is phase 2 so Trinity does not have much leverage to lower rates since it is a continuation of the migration and Trinity will want to retain the same resources.  Trinity?s strategy here may be to ask for a volume discount based on increasing spend with Slalom.",

        "current_narrative": "Progressive is accustomed to receiving best-in-class pricing for Dell EMC products and this proposal falls slightly short, despite including some considerable concessions. However, the discounts provided by EMC are still higher than the majority of EMC purchases that NPI reviews, and attaining further discounts will require careful negotiation.   Pricing Analysis NPI?s analysis incorporates 15 separate proposals. The methodology for this analysis categorizes each proposed line item into a specific EMC product ?family? (Centera, Data Domain, VxRack, etc.) and category (HW, SW, PS, Maint.), as discounting levels between different storage families and categories vary within the Dell EMC environment.  Because NPI data revolves around EMC product families and  because the fair discount ranges for each of these families varies, the analysis discusses discounts by family and category and concludes with target recommendations per each individual quote.  CENTERA ?\tCentera spend is 3% of the overall proposal spend, which is in line with industry observations of decreasing spend on this product family. o\tNPI continues to see clients migrating from this platform to more current offerings from EMC and/or other vendors. ?\tThe current proposal is discounted at 68% off list price for HW. NPI finds this pricing to be at FMV with room for improvement.  A discount target of 72% off list pricing would place Progressive in the best-in-class range.   Achieving this target will result in a savings of $16,342. ?\tNPI has seen some instances where it was difficult for clients to migrate from this platform.  Some migrations have been complex, and when issues arise, there are few Centera ?experts? remaining on the Dell EMC team to resolve problems. ?\tNPI has observed ?creative? pricing solutions where clients can achieve extremely deep discounts when bundling a planned migration/retirement of the Centera platform to a newer EMC offering.  These types of ?solutions? allow for a win-win scenario where the client can upgrade the platform, EMC can migrate off an older platform which is increasingly more difficult to support, and the sales team can deepen the EMC relationship with new products.  NPI recommends a careful ROI analysis on any new solutions proposed.  DATA DOMAIN ?\tEMC currently offers a 64% discount off list for both HW and Maintenance on the Data Domain (DD) family of products.  NPI finds this to be a low discount that places pricing above FMV. ?\tThe prior Data Domain purchase had a discount of 69% on a net price of $83K.  Current net pricing of $611K has a smaller, 64% discount off list.   ?\tA target of 69% to match prior discounting levels for this family of product will result in a savings of $89K.  ELASTIC CLOUD STORAGE (ECS) ?\tEMC offers discounts of 34.2% on their Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) product.  NPI finds this discount level to be too low, and pricing therefore too high given the deep relationship that Progressive has with EMC.   ?\tThis appears to be the initial entry point for this product family, which focuses on Software Defined Storage (SDS) for a turnkey, hyperscale storage infrastructure.  The current buy represents 14%, or $700K, of the current spend and spend in this family will likely grow in the future. ?\tNPI has seen discounts at the 40% level for a handful of clients.  As the Progressive relationship and spend continues to grow, NPI would expect nothing less than a discount of 40% in this area.  Achieving the 40% discount target will establish a solid discounting framework from which to baseline future purchases and will also result in savings of $62K on this purchase.  VBLOCK / VxBLOCK ?\tVBlock spend in this proposal appears to be maintenance-related spend of $230K that is not discounted. ?\tNPI finds that EMC maintenance spend is rarely discounted and pre-defined by EMC at the time of purchase (as it is based on the purchase price). ?\tNPI finds pricing to be within FMV for this renewal. VMAX ?\tNPI routinely observes Core VMAX purchases reach the high 70% and even low 80% discount ranges depending on size of purchase.  ?\tVMAX is one of two ?flagship products for EMC that they built from the ground up, but the platform has existed for some time and EMC?s margins have steadily grown.  ?\tNPI assumes that Progressive was able to reach (and exceed) the prior discount target of 80%, as prior discounting for Progressive was at 68% in December 2016.  Achieving that prior target of 80% would have yielded savings of $1.175M. ?\tProgressive is currently at 81% and NPI is confident that the current discounting for this family is at best-in-class pricing.   ?\tEMC traditionally applies discounts for all portions of software, hardware, and support at the same discount levels.  NPI typically finds elevated discounts in all areas Professional Services. ?\tEMC Professional Services are custom and customer-specific; engagement prices are priced by teams per business units. There is also little to no continuity across business units.  NPI rarely sees pricing concessions in this area.    Hardware Support and Warranty Upgrade OPTIONS:  ?\tWhile it is widely distributed and acknowledged that VMAX hardware comes with 3 years of support at the time of purchase, this support is Basic Support, or 24/7 remote support, with NBD delivery of replacements.  ?\tOf course, there is an upgraded level of support or Premium Support and, depending on the size of the purchase, this ?upgrade support? will either carry the same level of discounting as the hardware that it is providing coverage for or include it entirely.  o\tThe little-known or unknown side of support is that the 4th year can be included at the basic level for ?free? and at the same discount level for upgrade support, with no penalty or commission knock to the EMC Enterprise AM or Sales Team selling it.  VRACK / VxRACK ?\tProgressive had originally submitted two quote proposals to NPI for review.  Proposal P1112366 contained 2 sections, Prod and Non-Prod. Environments.  These two proposals were subsequently withdrawn. ?\tAlthough quote 6001450691 may need to be removed from this analysis, the PS figures associated with this quote are still included in this report.  As all VxRack charges are specifically broken into categorical spend, it will be relatively simple to remove the PS amount of $751,273 if necessary.  XTREMIO ?\tXtremIO is offered at a 64% discount for the majority of HW SKUs in this family.  Support is also offered at 64% off list pricing. This discount is too low and places pricing above FMV. NPI recommends a target discount of 72% to bring these items within FMV. o\tA single SKU that stands out in the XtremIO analysis is the InfiniBand Switch.  This switch was only discounted at 48.7%.  NPI believes this hardware should be discounted to the same discount rate as all other XtremIO HW. ?\tNPI has recently seen smaller deals achieve the 69% discount target at the $200K price point.  NPI believes that the significant spend with EMC should warrant best-in-class pricing and discounting for this product family. ?\tAs previously noted for the two maturing family lines above, the all-flash, high IO product offering by EMC is seen as a technology class that will continue to grow within the Progressive environment. Therefore, we strongly recommend that Progressive establish a solid discounting baseline for this product.  Achieving the targeted discount of 72% will result in savings of $230K. Negotiation Leverage and Strategy ?\tIt is NPI?s understanding that Progressive ?isn?t looking for ?deeper? discounting, but rather...for discounting that appreciates the deepening relationship that [they] have with EMC.? ?\tNPI recommends that Progressive stress that, as the EMC / Progressive relationship continues to strengthen and grow, Progressive would like to see the same discounting as previously offered by EMC.   ?\tOverall, targeted discounts are based on best-in-class pricing that Progressive has previously witnessed in prior purchases.",

        "description": "Hi Karen,  I have four sets of quotes that I need NPI to review for November deals. Let me know if you need additional information or if you would like me to contact Greg directly on these.   These sets are all EMC deals for storage  and virtual computing infrastructure.   Project 1 ? HCI infrastructure for DSE project  Project 2 ? vBlock Lease Extension for Prod and Non-prod racks  Project 3 ? Centera Evaluation Units purchase  Project 4 ? Q4 Storage Purchase (multi-platform)    Hi Chris, We?ve got a lot going on and I just was able to take a first pass.  ?\tThe first two files are VCE quotes with the same look and feel and list prices includes.  Reviewing won?t be a problem.  ?\tThe third and fourth files are one line item quotes in a standard EMC file format.  Not big dollars but no list price and a generic SKU.  These can?t be benchmarked in this format.  Do they relate to the VCE quotes? ?\tThe fifth file is another EMC quote.  No list prices but not a lot of items and we can fill in the blanks. ?\tThe sixth file is the biggest dollar quote.  No list prices and many worksheets.  I think it makes the most sense to ask EMC to revise with list prices. There?s even a column for it that they left blank. On prior NPI reviews for Progressive for EMC they furnished it.  This is the most efficient and accurate way to proceed.  Can you request that?  Can you share any info on timeline and context?  We reviewed another sizable purchase in December.  Would be interesting to understand how this relates to that purchase.   Try these quotes. The timeframe for these transactions are all in the next three weeks. The context is: the storage transactions are mostly to replace end of life units for the big storage quote, additional emergency capacity for the Centera storage, lease extension on the vblock units, and a new development/ production environment for the Prod/Non-Prod racks.    OUTCOME EMAIL (NO DOCS): EMC tends to bundle product and services with the greater discounts coming on services and associated software, at least for Progressive. On the vxblock / vxRail deal there was no appreciable additional discount received for this deal. We did receive services discounts in the amount of $125k tied to this purchase. On the storage deal (XtemeIO, Vmax, Data Domain, Centera) we received a total of $549k in software discounts and software substitution rights on a total spend of $3.027M for this purchase.   As we look toward renegotiating our current ELA with Dell EMC we will be seeking more favorable discounts rates across the board for HW, SW, and Services for the next term. We are clear that we left money on the table in the prior contract.",

        "current_narrative": "4/12: Final MA sent yesterday. 4/06: Completing final MA today. 3/9/18 - client to send final docs for MA.   2/23/18 - client got average of 16% off  M365 E3 and 20% off SCE.  Paperwork in finalized state.  2/16/18 - call with Grace, John, Chad to discuss MSFT's unwillingness to provide deal discount to true up table and future pricing.  NPI advice to hold firm, fall back to as -is if needed.  2/9/18- CTM received with custom language that allows downgrades of older versions for Office and specifically says customer will not deploy click to run.   Client received updated CPSs 2/8/18 and called to review.  We've returned calls and sent advice via email but have not heard from them as of the end of the day 2/8/18. 2/2/18 - client is receiving updated paperwork and language today/tomorrow.  They will let us know if they need anything else.  1/26/18 - AmierHealth legal is still awaiting response from MSFT legal regarding downgrade language.  1/19/18 - no update this week.  1/12/18 - sent email to client to advise that we make it clear to MSFT that delay in getting deal completed is due to MSFT's silence on request for final docs.   (language amendment and final CPS) 1/4/18 - client (Grace) called today to update NPI.  AmeriHealth trued up all call center employees and is going with MSFT Option 2 (one profile M365 E3 from SA).  Client is engaging internal counsel on language - this is a must for this deal to close.  Otherwise we will push for \"AS IS\".   12/29/17 - status call with client 12/29.   Awaiting MSFT decision on downgrade amendment.  BATNA is As-Is.  12/22/17 - client's MDO is M365E3 - working on getting SCE and EA to 3.3m per year.  Still need downgrade language .  Will elect full M365 E3 full USL for contractors.  12/8/17 -started more frequent  coaching sessions with client to discuss upcoming negotiations.  Client has 3 quotes - 0% as is, 7% M365 E3 and 14%-31% on M365E5.   12/1/17 - updated quotes due today.   Client is making nice progress on product decisions/reductions/migrations to EA from Select Plus.  John Nguygen agreed to talk to Chad Goodwin re: MA.  11/22/17 - checked in with client to get updated quotes from MSFT.  Client postponed meeting with them until we have these docs.  Meeting scheduled on 11/30 to discuss Server model change and proc to core results.  11/17/17 - Met with client to review project, plan, discuss MDO and request to MSFT for updated quotes and to review negotiation tactics for meeting with MSFT next week.  M365E3 is desired solution! Quote promised from MSFT today.  11/10/17 - met with client this week to discuss request for quotes and true up.   Client is making good progress on technical decisions although have not shared their ultimate MDO with us yet.   We are getting closer.  Still need VS information.  11/2/17 - client meeting with MSFT week of 11/6 and reviewing ME3/E5 and OE3/E5 solutions.  Still need Visual Studio details and another meeting to review Windows Server proc to core transition.  10/26/17 - Windows server details received on 10/25 and additional O365 meeting to be held afternoon of 10/26,  10/20/17 - onsite today for initial F&R.  10/13/17 - client has been sent MA but not agreed to it yet.  Plan to send 2 MPSA models to client to see options vs. renewing EA.  On site F&R scheduled on 10/20.  10/5/17 -call to discuss SAM was held on 10/5/17 and at client's request, status meeting to happen 10/6/17.  No new updates on counts or profiles, MDO, LAA, BATNA.  9/29/17 - client has new consultant on status calls, Dino, who formerly worked for them in IT and knows the rounds on MSFT.  Dino wanted NPI to perform SAM on MAP data (said it's 35 spreadsheets with 10s of 1000s or rows of raw data, there has been no hygeine on data, no correct allocation or assignment of licenses and no capturing of inactive users/devices).  Net is that this client doesn't think they will have numbers for us within the project term. Once dates provided by client, Cindy/Joshua to determine best time to go in person to \"work through\" F&R together with client.  9/21/17 - customer is working to finalize counts.  Windows Server information provided 9/20.  We are also working to set the baseline for MA.  8/31/17 - customer has new info on Citrix/RDS.  Working on new user counts/devices.   8/25/18 - client received MSFT quote on 8/24 - we are in process of reviewing.  Part 3 of infrastructure meeting on 8/28.  8/18/17 - held part one of infrastructure call this week, part 2 on Monday 8/21.  Wrote ghost written letter requesting quote from MSFT. 8/10/17 - new quotes received since last week.  Review of these is in process.  NPI setting up meeting with IT mgr responsible for Citrix to review environment and ensure licensing is correct.  SHI sent 3 year EA quotes vs. annual pricing and at LEVEL A!  Still need to talk through their basket of goods so we can  model out their most desired outcome.  8/4/17 - Joshua sent RDS/Citrix details to John/Stephen.  We are still awaiting quote - will follow up today if still no word.  7/28/17 - client received completely incorrect quote from SHI .  LSP quoted Select Plus. We will develop an MA. 3 years remaining.  Cindy advised going back and requesting correction as line items referenced \"select plus\".  AmeriHealth found out from LSP that they no longer qualifyt for Level D pricing as MSFT will no longer allow their inclusion in the \"association\".  Need to understand this - likely the shake up of the healthcare vertical with MSFT internally is causing this.  It's also possible that they are getting a new account team - this is just speculation, but we can use this to help negotiation as well.  Client wants info on deployment of SQL subscriptions on SCE as potential licensing model for Performacare.  Cindy following up and initially believes this should be similar to EAS licensing and capable of on-prem deployment.  Client sent Citrix question to Josh on RDS - Cindy/Joshua to review.  7/21/17 - client has requested specific SQL modeling for an affiliate that was \"missed\" at last true up.  Wants all options - SQL is covered product family in SCE.   We review SCE including subscription.  7/14/17 - had status meeting on 7/13/17.  Client wants further analysis of options to license SQL cores on a majority owned affiliate, PerformCare  that hasn't been covered in SCE previously..  Client requested as is quotes from MSFT and is looking into MSDN oversubcriptions. Client will also be sending details on licensing requirements for virtualized apps on Large Citrix implementation. 7/7/17 - sent ghostwritten message to client for request of as-is quotes.   6/30 - Discovery meeting attended by John, Stephen and Anthony, which was a lighter audience than expected, but had very good dialogue and ran way over time. 6/23 - Confusion around the Discovery meeting, slated for next week now, however still awaiting final server information. 6/16: discovery mtg 6/29 - awaiting details fro client so we can perform calcs and analysis. 6/01/17 - Completed interviews and received final documents.  Still need final server numbers for Windows/Systems Center for Discovery Report and initial 'As Is' estimate and working to schedule Discovery meeting. 5/12/2017 - Same as last week, no material progress as of yet. 5/5/2017 - Had bi-weekly call and discussed project timeline, questionnaire deadline and next steps.  Also lots of Q&A and coaching on preparation. 4/28:  Client happy. Meeting was a waste.  Really wanted a meet and greet with the team.  Better to have tied it to a deliverable event.  4/21:  On-site on Tuesday for strategy discussion and planning the approach to MSFT.  4/7:  Surprised that their executive was trying to close 9 mos. before expiration.  Trying to delay on-site so not to disrupt other deals. 3/31:  Held kickoff.  Good start, especially with John Ng.  3/24:  Kickoff next week.  3/17/2017 - Official kickoff being scheduled for next week or the week after. 3/10/2017 - No major update to report, working on kickoff date once John is back. 3/3/17 - Drafted project plan for John Nguyen, hoping to have kickoff next week or week after.",

        "description": "Msft EA Renewal, part of subscription.  We spent near a year working on Discovery, with many options and and a lot of planning.  We even uncovered numerous non-compliant situations and provided specific advice on how to rectify.  The customer was very interested in O365 as a potential option, but getting the right discount and pricing was very important.  Of course, they were very concerned with security as well, but once they got past that concern it was a solid decision to move forward with an O365 option.  Unfortunately Grace was waiting in the wings to take over and pull NPI out for the final rounds.  She was frustrated with MSFT's resistance to her strategy, but her boss ended up coming back to us, along with John Ngyuen, and seeking our advice and benchmarking for the final rounds.  Ultimately they got a good deal, it could have been better if they would have followed our advice, but as we found out, Grace wanted to discontinue our relationship and even went as far as to say that they know as much as NPI and don't need any of our benchmarking any longer.  Also that they are premier negotiators now.",

The barrier to achieving savings here is that this is phase 2 so Trinity does not have much leverage to lower rates since it is a continuation of the migration and Trinity will want to retain the same resources.

        "current_narrative": "Progressive is accustomed to receiving best-in-class pricing for Dell EMC products and this proposal falls slightly short, despite including some considerable concessions. However, the discounts provided by EMC are still higher than the majority of EMC purchases that NPI reviews, and attaining further discounts will require careful negotiation.   Pricing Analysis NPI?s analysis incorporates 15 separate proposals. The methodology for this analysis categorizes each proposed line item into a specific EMC product ?family? (Centera, Data Domain, VxRack, etc.) and category (HW, SW, PS, Maint.), as discounting levels between different storage families and categories vary within the Dell EMC environment.  Because NPI data revolves around EMC product families and  because the fair discount ranges for each of these families varies, the analysis discusses discounts by family and category and concludes with target recommendations per each individual quote.  CENTERA ?\tCentera spend is 3% of the overall proposal spend, which is in line with industry observations of decreasing spend on this product family. o\tNPI continues to see clients migrating from this platform to more current offerings from EMC and/or other vendors. ?\tThe current proposal is discounted at 68% off list price for HW. NPI finds this pricing to be at FMV with room for improvement.  A discount target of 72% off list pricing would place Progressive in the best-in-class range.   Achieving this target will result in a savings of $16,342. ?\tNPI has seen some instances where it was difficult for clients to migrate from this platform.  Some migrations have been complex, and when issues arise, there are few Centera ?experts? remaining on the Dell EMC team to resolve problems. ?\tNPI has observed ?creative? pricing solutions where clients can achieve extremely deep discounts when bundling a planned migration/retirement of the Centera platform to a newer EMC offering.  These types of ?solutions? allow for a win-win scenario where the client can upgrade the platform, EMC can migrate off an older platform which is increasingly more difficult to support, and the sales team can deepen the EMC relationship with new products.  NPI recommends a careful ROI analysis on any new solutions proposed.  DATA DOMAIN ?\tEMC currently offers a 64% discount off list for both HW and Maintenance on the Data Domain (DD) family of products.  NPI finds this to be a low discount that places pricing above FMV. ?\tThe prior Data Domain purchase had a discount of 69% on a net price of $83K.  Current net pricing of $611K has a smaller, 64% discount off list.   ?\tA target of 69% to match prior discounting levels for this family of product will result in a savings of $89K.  ELASTIC CLOUD STORAGE (ECS) ?\tEMC offers discounts of 34.2% on their Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) product.  NPI finds this discount level to be too low, and pricing therefore too high given the deep relationship that Progressive has with EMC.   ?\tThis appears to be the initial entry point for this product family, which focuses on Software Defined Storage (SDS) for a turnkey, hyperscale storage infrastructure.  The current buy represents 14%, or $700K, of the current spend and spend in this family will likely grow in the future. ?\tNPI has seen discounts at the 40% level for a handful of clients.  As the Progressive relationship and spend continues to grow, NPI would expect nothing less than a discount of 40% in this area.  Achieving the 40% discount target will establish a solid discounting framework from which to baseline future purchases and will also result in savings of $62K on this purchase.  VBLOCK / VxBLOCK ?\tVBlock spend in this proposal appears to be maintenance-related spend of $230K that is not discounted. ?\tNPI finds that EMC maintenance spend is rarely discounted and pre-defined by EMC at the time of purchase (as it is based on the purchase price). ?\tNPI finds pricing to be within FMV for this renewal. VMAX ?\tNPI routinely observes Core VMAX purchases reach the high 70% and even low 80% discount ranges depending on size of purchase.  ?\tVMAX is one of two ?flagship products for EMC that they built from the ground up, but the platform has existed for some time and EMC?s margins have steadily grown.  ?\tNPI assumes that Progressive was able to reach (and exceed) the prior discount target of 80%, as prior discounting for Progressive was at 68% in December 2016.  Achieving that prior target of 80% would have yielded savings of $1.175M. ?\tProgressive is currently at 81% and NPI is confident that the current discounting for this family is at best-in-class pricing.   ?\tEMC traditionally applies discounts for all portions of software, hardware, and support at the same discount levels.  NPI typically finds elevated discounts in all areas Professional Services. ?\tEMC Professional Services are custom and customer-specific; engagement prices are priced by teams per business units. There is also little to no continuity across business units.  NPI rarely sees pricing concessions in this area.    Hardware Support and Warranty Upgrade OPTIONS:  ?\tWhile it is widely distributed and acknowledged that VMAX hardware comes with 3 years of support at the time of purchase, this support is Basic Support, or 24/7 remote support, with NBD delivery of replacements.  ?\tOf course, there is an upgraded level of support or Premium Support and, depending on the size of the purchase, this ?upgrade support? will either carry the same level of discounting as the hardware that it is providing coverage for or include it entirely.  o\tThe little-known or unknown side of support is that the 4th year can be included at the basic level for ?free? and at the same discount level for upgrade support, with no penalty or commission knock to the EMC Enterprise AM or Sales Team selling it.  VRACK / VxRACK ?\tProgressive had originally submitted two quote proposals to NPI for review.  Proposal P1112366 contained 2 sections, Prod and Non-Prod. Environments.  These two proposals were subsequently withdrawn. ?\tAlthough quote 6001450691 may need to be removed from this analysis, the PS figures associated with this quote are still included in this report.  As all VxRack charges are specifically broken into categorical spend, it will be relatively simple to remove the PS amount of $751,273 if necessary.  XTREMIO ?\tXtremIO is offered at a 64% discount for the majority of HW SKUs in this family.  Support is also offered at 64% off list pricing. This discount is too low and places pricing above FMV. NPI recommends a target discount of 72% to bring these items within FMV. o\tA single SKU that stands out in the XtremIO analysis is the InfiniBand Switch.  This switch was only discounted at 48.7%.  NPI believes this hardware should be discounted to the same discount rate as all other XtremIO HW. ?\tNPI has recently seen smaller deals achieve the 69% discount target at the $200K price point.  NPI believes that the significant spend with EMC should warrant best-in-class pricing and discounting for this product family. ?\tAs previously noted for the two maturing family lines above, the all-flash, high IO product offering by EMC is seen as a technology class that will continue to grow within the Progressive environment. Therefore, we strongly recommend that Progressive establish a solid discounting baseline for this product.  Achieving the targeted discount of 72% will result in savings of $230K. Negotiation Leverage and Strategy ?\tIt is NPI?s understanding that Progressive ?isn?t looking for ?deeper? discounting, but rather...for discounting that appreciates the deepening relationship that [they] have with EMC.? ?\tNPI recommends that Progressive stress that, as the EMC / Progressive relationship continues to strengthen and grow, Progressive would like to see the same discounting as previously offered by EMC.   ?\tOverall, targeted discounts are based on best-in-class pricing that Progressive has previously witnessed in prior purchases.",

        "description": "Hi Karen,  I have four sets of quotes that I need NPI to review for November deals. Let me know if you need additional information or if you would like me to contact Greg directly on these.   These sets are all EMC deals for storage  and virtual computing infrastructure.   Project 1 ? HCI infrastructure for DSE project  Project 2 ? vBlock Lease Extension for Prod and Non-prod racks  Project 3 ? Centera Evaluation Units purchase  Project 4 ? Q4 Storage Purchase (multi-platform)    Hi Chris, We?ve got a lot going on and I just was able to take a first pass.  ?\tThe first two files are VCE quotes with the same look and feel and list prices includes.  Reviewing won?t be a problem.  ?\tThe third and fourth files are one line item quotes in a standard EMC file format.  Not big dollars but no list price and a generic SKU.  These can?t be benchmarked in this format.  Do they relate to the VCE quotes? ?\tThe fifth file is another EMC quote.  No list prices but not a lot of items and we can fill in the blanks. ?\tThe sixth file is the biggest dollar quote.  No list prices and many worksheets.  I think it makes the most sense to ask EMC to revise with list prices. There?s even a column for it that they left blank. On prior NPI reviews for Progressive for EMC they furnished it.  This is the most efficient and accurate way to proceed.  Can you request that?  Can you share any info on timeline and context?  We reviewed another sizable purchase in December.  Would be interesting to understand how this relates to that purchase.   Try these quotes. The timeframe for these transactions are all in the next three weeks. The context is: the storage transactions are mostly to replace end of life units for the big storage quote, additional emergency capacity for the Centera storage, lease extension on the vblock units, and a new development/ production environment for the Prod/Non-Prod racks.    OUTCOME EMAIL (NO DOCS): EMC tends to bundle product and services with the greater discounts coming on services and associated software, at least for Progressive. On the vxblock / vxRail deal there was no appreciable additional discount received for this deal. We did receive services discounts in the amount of $125k tied to this purchase. On the storage deal (XtemeIO, Vmax, Data Domain, Centera) we received a total of $549k in software discounts and software substitution rights on a total spend of $3.027M for this purchase.   As we look toward renegotiating our current ELA with Dell EMC we will be seeking more favorable discounts rates across the board for HW, SW, and Services for the next term. We are clear that we left money on the table in the prior contract.",

        "current_narrative": "4/12: Final MA sent yesterday. 4/06: Completing final MA today. 3/9/18 - client to send final docs for MA.   2/23/18 - client got average of 16% off  M365 E3 and 20% off SCE.  Paperwork in finalized state.  2/16/18 - call with Grace, John, Chad to discuss MSFT's unwillingness to provide deal discount to true up table and future pricing.  NPI advice to hold firm, fall back to as -is if needed.  2/9/18- CTM received with custom language that allows downgrades of older versions for Office and specifically says customer will not deploy click to run.   Client received updated CPSs 2/8/18 and called to review.  We've returned calls and sent advice via email but have not heard from them as of the end of the day 2/8/18. 2/2/18 - client is receiving updated paperwork and language today/tomorrow.  They will let us know if they need anything else.  1/26/18 - AmierHealth legal is still awaiting response from MSFT legal regarding downgrade language.  1/19/18 - no update this week.  1/12/18 - sent email to client to advise that we make it clear to MSFT that delay in getting deal completed is due to MSFT's silence on request for final docs.   (language amendment and final CPS) 1/4/18 - client (Grace) called today to update NPI.  AmeriHealth trued up all call center employees and is going with MSFT Option 2 (one profile M365 E3 from SA).  Client is engaging internal counsel on language - this is a must for this deal to close.  Otherwise we will push for \"AS IS\".   12/29/17 - status call with client 12/29.   Awaiting MSFT decision on downgrade amendment.  BATNA is As-Is.  12/22/17 - client's MDO is M365E3 - working on getting SCE and EA to 3.3m per year.  Still need downgrade language .  Will elect full M365 E3 full USL for contractors.  12/8/17 -started more frequent  coaching sessions with client to discuss upcoming negotiations.  Client has 3 quotes - 0% as is, 7% M365 E3 and 14%-31% on M365E5.   12/1/17 - updated quotes due today.   Client is making nice progress on product decisions/reductions/migrations to EA from Select Plus.  John Nguygen agreed to talk to Chad Goodwin re: MA.  11/22/17 - checked in with client to get updated quotes from MSFT.  Client postponed meeting with them until we have these docs.  Meeting scheduled on 11/30 to discuss Server model change and proc to core results.  11/17/17 - Met with client to review project, plan, discuss MDO and request to MSFT for updated quotes and to review negotiation tactics for meeting with MSFT next week.  M365E3 is desired solution! Quote promised from MSFT today.  11/10/17 - met with client this week to discuss request for quotes and true up.   Client is making good progress on technical decisions although have not shared their ultimate MDO with us yet.   We are getting closer.  Still need VS information.  11/2/17 - client meeting with MSFT week of 11/6 and reviewing ME3/E5 and OE3/E5 solutions.  Still need Visual Studio details and another meeting to review Windows Server proc to core transition.  10/26/17 - Windows server details received on 10/25 and additional O365 meeting to be held afternoon of 10/26,  10/20/17 - onsite today for initial F&R.  10/13/17 - client has been sent MA but not agreed to it yet.  Plan to send 2 MPSA models to client to see options vs. renewing EA.  On site F&R scheduled on 10/20.  10/5/17 -call to discuss SAM was held on 10/5/17 and at client's request, status meeting to happen 10/6/17.  No new updates on counts or profiles, MDO, LAA, BATNA.  9/29/17 - client has new consultant on status calls, Dino, who formerly worked for them in IT and knows the rounds on MSFT.  Dino wanted NPI to perform SAM on MAP data (said it's 35 spreadsheets with 10s of 1000s or rows of raw data, there has been no hygeine on data, no correct allocation or assignment of licenses and no capturing of inactive users/devices).  Net is that this client doesn't think they will have numbers for us within the project term. Once dates provided by client, Cindy/Joshua to determine best time to go in person to \"work through\" F&R together with client.  9/21/17 - customer is working to finalize counts.  Windows Server information provided 9/20.  We are also working to set the baseline for MA.  8/31/17 - customer has new info on Citrix/RDS.  Working on new user counts/devices.   8/25/18 - client received MSFT quote on 8/24 - we are in process of reviewing.  Part 3 of infrastructure meeting on 8/28.  8/18/17 - held part one of infrastructure call this week, part 2 on Monday 8/21.  Wrote ghost written letter requesting quote from MSFT. 8/10/17 - new quotes received since last week.  Review of these is in process.  NPI setting up meeting with IT mgr responsible for Citrix to review environment and ensure licensing is correct.  SHI sent 3 year EA quotes vs. annual pricing and at LEVEL A!  Still need to talk through their basket of goods so we can  model out their most desired outcome.  8/4/17 - Joshua sent RDS/Citrix details to John/Stephen.  We are still awaiting quote - will follow up today if still no word.  7/28/17 - client received completely incorrect quote from SHI .  LSP quoted Select Plus. We will develop an MA. 3 years remaining.  Cindy advised going back and requesting correction as line items referenced \"select plus\".  AmeriHealth found out from LSP that they no longer qualifyt for Level D pricing as MSFT will no longer allow their inclusion in the \"association\".  Need to understand this - likely the shake up of the healthcare vertical with MSFT internally is causing this.  It's also possible that they are getting a new account team - this is just speculation, but we can use this to help negotiation as well.  Client wants info on deployment of SQL subscriptions on SCE as potential licensing model for Performacare.  Cindy following up and initially believes this should be similar to EAS licensing and capable of on-prem deployment.  Client sent Citrix question to Josh on RDS - Cindy/Joshua to review.  7/21/17 - client has requested specific SQL modeling for an affiliate that was \"missed\" at last true up.  Wants all options - SQL is covered product family in SCE.   We review SCE including subscription.  7/14/17 - had status meeting on 7/13/17.  Client wants further analysis of options to license SQL cores on a majority owned affiliate, PerformCare  that hasn't been covered in SCE previously..  Client requested as is quotes from MSFT and is looking into MSDN oversubcriptions. Client will also be sending details on licensing requirements for virtualized apps on Large Citrix implementation. 7/7/17 - sent ghostwritten message to client for request of as-is quotes.   6/30 - Discovery meeting attended by John, Stephen and Anthony, which was a lighter audience than expected, but had very good dialogue and ran way over time. 6/23 - Confusion around the Discovery meeting, slated for next week now, however still awaiting final server information. 6/16: discovery mtg 6/29 - awaiting details fro client so we can perform calcs and analysis. 6/01/17 - Completed interviews and received final documents.  Still need final server numbers for Windows/Systems Center for Discovery Report and initial 'As Is' estimate and working to schedule Discovery meeting. 5/12/2017 - Same as last week, no material progress as of yet. 5/5/2017 - Had bi-weekly call and discussed project timeline, questionnaire deadline and next steps.  Also lots of Q&A and coaching on preparation. 4/28:  Client happy. Meeting was a waste.  Really wanted a meet and greet with the team.  Better to have tied it to a deliverable event.  4/21:  On-site on Tuesday for strategy discussion and planning the approach to MSFT.  4/7:  Surprised that their executive was trying to close 9 mos. before expiration.  Trying to delay on-site so not to disrupt other deals. 3/31:  Held kickoff.  Good start, especially with John Ng.  3/24:  Kickoff next week.  3/17/2017 - Official kickoff being scheduled for next week or the week after. 3/10/2017 - No major update to report, working on kickoff date once John is back. 3/3/17 - Drafted project plan for John Nguyen, hoping to have kickoff next week or week after.",

        "description": "Msft EA Renewal, part of subscription.  We spent near a year working on Discovery, with many options and and a lot of planning.  We even uncovered numerous non-compliant situations and provided specific advice on how to rectify.  The customer was very interested in O365 as a potential option, but getting the right discount and pricing was very important.  Of course, they were very concerned with security as well, but once they got past that concern it was a solid decision to move forward with an O365 option.  Unfortunately Grace was waiting in the wings to take over and pull NPI out for the final rounds.  She was frustrated with MSFT's resistance to her strategy, but her boss ended up coming back to us, along with John Ngyuen, and seeking our advice and benchmarking for the final rounds.  Ultimately they got a good deal, it could have been better if they would have followed our advice, but as we found out, Grace wanted to discontinue our relationship and even went as far as to say that they know as much as NPI and don't need any of our benchmarking any longer.  Also that they are premier negotiators now.",

Final ELA was at 80%+ as well. See attached email with feedback and Steve's reply about progress to date.  Response when I sent feedback: Thank you, this is insightful and scary.. Charles and I will review, while we are waiting on a response from SAS on MLA discount terms we believe we have locked in as we discussed. SAS promised yesterday, Bob Mann reached out again this morning, still nothing.   Lastly, I reached out to BU with EM questions, and he is traveling and did not have access to some data in order to answer. Expecting a response there as well.

        "current_narrative": "Pricing Analysis ?\tNPI combined both proposals to provide a consolidated view of the Brocade hardware renewal.    SEE FMV for details.  The NPI analysis of the Brocade proposals finds the various discounting on the models to be unusual for a Brocade renewal.   The majority of the HW in this renewal is less than 5 years old as stated by Morgan Stanley.  As HW increases in age, hardware manufacturers will often begin a steady increase in maintenance costs to ?encourage? a hardware refresh.    Data shows the typical 5% Y/Y increase on many of the items yet tied to the unusual discounting, NPI is also seeing some unusual increases and decreases (which appear to be tied to a reduction in support levels). It makes for a lot of moving parts year over year.  NPI calculated a blended discount rate of 30.9% and finds discount to be below our FMV range.  NPI will often see discounts in the 40% - 45% range for renewals near the $1M range.  NPI does not see any particular rationale as to why discounting should vary between hardware models and recommends a FMV target of a straight 47% on all SKUs.  In this exercise, NPI actually reduced discounts on some SKUs (that NPI believed to be unusually high) to the same 47%.  Achieving this target will result in a savings of $180K.  The FMV target of 47% on all renewal SKUs would be considered ?best-in-classs? pricing.  NPI is targeting this level of pricing because of the potential sales opportunities that MS is considering in the near future.  Premier Onsite Support Engineer (OSE) is currently discounted at 33%.  NPI targets $192,000 or a 40% discount as FMV.  This FMV target will land the OSE at $96/hr.   Achieving this target will result in $24,000 in additional savings.

        "current_narrative": "Progressive is accustomed to receiving best-in-class pricing for Dell EMC products and this proposal falls slightly short, despite including some considerable concessions. However, the discounts provided by EMC are still higher than the majority of EMC purchases that NPI reviews, and attaining further discounts will require careful negotiation.   Pricing Analysis NPI?s analysis incorporates 15 separate proposals. The methodology for this analysis categorizes each proposed line item into a specific EMC product ?family? (Centera, Data Domain, VxRack, etc.) and category (HW, SW, PS, Maint.), as discounting levels between different storage families and categories vary within the Dell EMC environment.  Because NPI data revolves around EMC product families and  because the fair discount ranges for each of these families varies, the analysis discusses discounts by family and category and concludes with target recommendations per each individual quote.  CENTERA ?\tCentera spend is 3% of the overall proposal spend, which is in line with industry observations of decreasing spend on this product family. o\tNPI continues to see clients migrating from this platform to more current offerings from EMC and/or other vendors. ?\tThe current proposal is discounted at 68% off list price for HW. NPI finds this pricing to be at FMV with room for improvement.  A discount target of 72% off list pricing would place Progressive in the best-in-class range.   Achieving this target will result in a savings of $16,342. ?\tNPI has seen some instances where it was difficult for clients to migrate from this platform.  Some migrations have been complex, and when issues arise, there are few Centera ?experts? remaining on the Dell EMC team to resolve problems. ?\tNPI has observed ?creative? pricing solutions where clients can achieve extremely deep discounts when bundling a planned migration/retirement of the Centera platform to a newer EMC offering.  These types of ?solutions? allow for a win-win scenario where the client can upgrade the platform, EMC can migrate off an older platform which is increasingly more difficult to support, and the sales team can deepen the EMC relationship with new products.  NPI recommends a careful ROI analysis on any new solutions proposed.  DATA DOMAIN ?\tEMC currently offers a 64% discount off list for both HW and Maintenance on the Data Domain (DD) family of products.  NPI finds this to be a low discount that places pricing above FMV. ?\tThe prior Data Domain purchase had a discount of 69% on a net price of $83K.  Current net pricing of $611K has a smaller, 64% discount off list.   ?\tA target of 69% to match prior discounting levels for this family of product will result in a savings of $89K.  ELASTIC CLOUD STORAGE (ECS) ?\tEMC offers discounts of 34.2% on their Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) product.  NPI finds this discount level to be too low, and pricing therefore too high given the deep relationship that Progressive has with EMC.   ?\tThis appears to be the initial entry point for this product family, which focuses on Software Defined Storage (SDS) for a turnkey, hyperscale storage infrastructure.  The current buy represents 14%, or $700K, of the current spend and spend in this family will likely grow in the future. ?\tNPI has seen discounts at the 40% level for a handful of clients.  As the Progressive relationship and spend continues to grow, NPI would expect nothing less than a discount of 40% in this area.  Achieving the 40% discount target will establish a solid discounting framework from which to baseline future purchases and will also result in savings of $62K on this purchase.  VBLOCK / VxBLOCK ?\tVBlock spend in this proposal appears to be maintenance-related spend of $230K that is not discounted. ?\tNPI finds that EMC maintenance spend is rarely discounted and pre-defined by EMC at the time of purchase (as it is based on the purchase price). ?\tNPI finds pricing to be within FMV for this renewal. VMAX ?\tNPI routinely observes Core VMAX purchases reach the high 70% and even low 80% discount ranges depending on size of purchase.  ?\tVMAX is one of two ?flagship products for EMC that they built from the ground up, but the platform has existed for some time and EMC?s margins have steadily grown.  ?\tNPI assumes that Progressive was able to reach (and exceed) the prior discount target of 80%, as prior discounting for Progressive was at 68% in December 2016.  Achieving that prior target of 80% would have yielded savings of $1.175M. ?\tProgressive is currently at 81% and NPI is confident that the current discounting for this family is at best-in-class pricing.   ?\tEMC traditionally applies discounts for all portions of software, hardware, and support at the same discount levels.  NPI typically finds elevated discounts in all areas Professional Services. ?\tEMC Professional Services are custom and customer-specific; engagement prices are priced by teams per business units. There is also little to no continuity across business units.  NPI rarely sees pricing concessions in this area.    Hardware Support and Warranty Upgrade OPTIONS:  ?\tWhile it is widely distributed and acknowledged that VMAX hardware comes with 3 years of support at the time of purchase, this support is Basic Support, or 24/7 remote support, with NBD delivery of replacements.  ?\tOf course, there is an upgraded level of support or Premium Support and, depending on the size of the purchase, this ?upgrade support? will either carry the same level of discounting as the hardware that it is providing coverage for or include it entirely.  o\tThe little-known or unknown side of support is that the 4th year can be included at the basic level for ?free? and at the same discount level for upgrade support, with no penalty or commission knock to the EMC Enterprise AM or Sales Team selling it.  VRACK / VxRACK ?\tProgressive had originally submitted two quote proposals to NPI for review.  Proposal P1112366 contained 2 sections, Prod and Non-Prod. Environments.  These two proposals were subsequently withdrawn. ?\tAlthough quote 6001450691 may need to be removed from this analysis, the PS figures associated with this quote are still included in this report.  As all VxRack charges are specifically broken into categorical spend, it will be relatively simple to remove the PS amount of $751,273 if necessary.  XTREMIO ?\tXtremIO is offered at a 64% discount for the majority of HW SKUs in this family.  Support is also offered at 64% off list pricing. This discount is too low and places pricing above FMV. NPI recommends a target discount of 72% to bring these items within FMV. o\tA single SKU that stands out in the XtremIO analysis is the InfiniBand Switch.  This switch was only discounted at 48.7%.  NPI believes this hardware should be discounted to the same discount rate as all other XtremIO HW. ?\tNPI has recently seen smaller deals achieve the 69% discount target at the $200K price point.  NPI believes that the significant spend with EMC should warrant best-in-class pricing and discounting for this product family. ?\tAs previously noted for the two maturing family lines above, the all-flash, high IO product offering by EMC is seen as a technology class that will continue to grow within the Progressive environment. Therefore, we strongly recommend that Progressive establish a solid discounting baseline for this product.  Achieving the targeted discount of 72% will result in savings of $230K. Negotiation Leverage and Strategy ?\tIt is NPI?s understanding that Progressive ?isn?t looking for ?deeper? discounting, but rather...for discounting that appreciates the deepening relationship that [they] have with EMC.? ?\tNPI recommends that Progressive stress that, as the EMC / Progressive relationship continues to strengthen and grow, Progressive would like to see the same discounting as previously offered by EMC.   ?\tOverall, targeted discounts are based on best-in-class pricing that Progressive has previously witnessed in prior purchases.",

        "description": "Hi Karen,  I have four sets of quotes that I need NPI to review for November deals. Let me know if you need additional information or if you would like me to contact Greg directly on these.   These sets are all EMC deals for storage  and virtual computing infrastructure.   Project 1 ? HCI infrastructure for DSE project  Project 2 ? vBlock Lease Extension for Prod and Non-prod racks  Project 3 ? Centera Evaluation Units purchase  Project 4 ? Q4 Storage Purchase (multi-platform)    Hi Chris, We?ve got a lot going on and I just was able to take a first pass.  ?\tThe first two files are VCE quotes with the same look and feel and list prices includes.  Reviewing won?t be a problem.  ?\tThe third and fourth files are one line item quotes in a standard EMC file format.  Not big dollars but no list price and a generic SKU.  These can?t be benchmarked in this format.  Do they relate to the VCE quotes? ?\tThe fifth file is another EMC quote.  No list prices but not a lot of items and we can fill in the blanks. ?\tThe sixth file is the biggest dollar quote.  No list prices and many worksheets.  I think it makes the most sense to ask EMC to revise with list prices. There?s even a column for it that they left blank. On prior NPI reviews for Progressive for EMC they furnished it.  This is the most efficient and accurate way to proceed.  Can you request that?  Can you share any info on timeline and context?  We reviewed another sizable purchase in December.  Would be interesting to understand how this relates to that purchase.   Try these quotes. The timeframe for these transactions are all in the next three weeks. The context is: the storage transactions are mostly to replace end of life units for the big storage quote, additional emergency capacity for the Centera storage, lease extension on the vblock units, and a new development/ production environment for the Prod/Non-Prod racks.    OUTCOME EMAIL (NO DOCS): EMC tends to bundle product and services with the greater discounts coming on services and associated software, at least for Progressive. On the vxblock / vxRail deal there was no appreciable additional discount received for this deal. We did receive services discounts in the amount of $125k tied to this purchase. On the storage deal (XtemeIO, Vmax, Data Domain, Centera) we received a total of $549k in software discounts and software substitution rights on a total spend of $3.027M for this purchase.   As we look toward renegotiating our current ELA with Dell EMC we will be seeking more favorable discounts rates across the board for HW, SW, and Services for the next term. We are clear that we left money on the table in the prior contract.",

They will let us know if they need anything else.  1/26/18 - AmierHealth legal is still awaiting response from MSFT legal regarding downgrade language.  1/19/18 - no update this week.  1/12/18 - sent email to client to advise that we make it clear to MSFT that delay in getting deal completed is due to MSFT's silence on request for final docs.   (language amendment and final CPS) 1/4/18 - client (Grace) called today to update NPI.  AmeriHealth trued up all call center employees and is going with MSFT Option 2 (one profile M365 E3 from SA).  Client is engaging internal counsel on language - this is a must for this deal to close.  Otherwise we will push for \"AS IS\".   12/29/17 - status call with client 12/29.   Awaiting MSFT decision on downgrade amendment.  BATNA is As-Is.  12/22/17 - client's MDO is M365E3 - working on getting SCE and EA to 3.3m per year.  Still need downgrade language .  Will elect full M365 E3 full USL for contractors.  12/8/17 -started more frequent  coaching sessions with client to discuss upcoming negotiations.  Client has 3 quotes - 0% as is, 7% M365 E3 and 14%-31% on M365E5.   12/1/17 - updated quotes due today.   Client is making nice progress on product decisions/reductions/migrations to EA from Select Plus.  John Nguygen agreed to talk to Chad Goodwin re: MA.  11/22/17 - checked in with client to get updated quotes from MSFT.  Client postponed meeting with them until we have these docs.  Meeting scheduled on 11/30 to discuss Server model change and proc to core results.  11/17/17 - Met with client to review project, plan, discuss MDO and request to MSFT for updated quotes and to review negotiation tactics for meeting with MSFT next week.  M365E3 is desired solution! Quote promised from MSFT today.  11/10/17 - met with client this week to discuss request for quotes and true up.   Client is making good progress on technical decisions although have not shared their ultimate MDO with us yet.   We are getting closer.  Still need VS information.  11/2/17 - client meeting with MSFT week of 11/6 and reviewing ME3/E5 and OE3/E5 solutions.  Still need Visual Studio details and another meeting to review Windows Server proc to core transition.  10/26/17 - Windows server details received on 10/25 and additional O365 meeting to be held afternoon of 10/26,  10/20/17 - onsite today for initial F&R.  10/13/17 - client has been sent MA but not agreed to it yet.  Plan to send 2 MPSA models to client to see options vs. renewing EA.  On site F&R scheduled on 10/20.  10/5/17 -call to discuss SAM was held on 10/5/17 and at client's request, status meeting to happen 10/6/17.  No new updates on counts or profiles, MDO, LAA, BATNA.  9/29/17 - client has new consultant on status calls, Dino, who formerly worked for them in IT and knows the rounds on MSFT.  Dino wanted NPI to perform SAM on MAP data (said it's 35 spreadsheets with 10s of 1000s or rows of raw data, there has been no hygeine on data, no correct allocation or assignment of licenses and no capturing of inactive users/devices).  Net is that this client doesn't think they will have numbers for us within the project term. Once dates provided by client, Cindy/Joshua to determine best time to go in person to \"work through\" F&R together with client.  9/21/17 - customer is working to finalize counts.  Windows Server information provided 9/20.  We are also working to set the baseline for MA.  8/31/17 - customer has new info on Citrix/RDS.  Working on new user counts/devices.   8/25/18 - client received MSFT quote on 8/24 - we are in process of reviewing.  Part 3 of infrastructure meeting on 8/28.  8/18/17 - held part one of infrastructure call this week, part 2 on Monday 8/21.  Wrote ghost written letter requesting quote from MSFT. 8/10/17 - new quotes received since last week.  Review of these is in process.  NPI setting up meeting with IT mgr responsible for Citrix to review environment and ensure licensing is correct.  SHI sent 3 year EA quotes vs. annual pricing and at LEVEL A!  Still need to talk through their basket of goods so we can  model out their most desired outcome.  8/4/17 - Joshua sent RDS/Citrix details to John/Stephen.  We are still awaiting quote - will follow up today if still no word.  7/28/17 - client received completely incorrect quote from SHI .  LSP quoted Select Plus. We will develop an MA. 3 years remaining.  Cindy advised going back and requesting correction as line items referenced \"select plus\".  AmeriHealth found out from LSP that they no longer qualifyt for Level D pricing as MSFT will no longer allow their inclusion in the \"association\".  Need to understand this - likely the shake up of the healthcare vertical with MSFT internally is causing this.  It's also possible that they are getting a new account team - this is just speculation, but we can use this to help negotiation as well.  Client wants info on deployment of SQL subscriptions on SCE as potential licensing model for Performacare.  Cindy following up and initially believes this should be similar to EAS licensing and capable of on-prem deployment.  Client sent Citrix question to Josh on RDS - Cindy/Joshua to review.  7/21/17 - client has requested specific SQL modeling for an affiliate that was \"missed\" at last true up.  Wants all options - SQL is covered product family in SCE.   We review SCE including subscription.  7/14/17 - had status meeting on 7/13/17.  Client wants further analysis of options to license SQL cores on a majority owned affiliate, PerformCare  that hasn't been covered in SCE previously..  Client requested as is quotes from MSFT and is looking into MSDN oversubcriptions. Client will also be sending details on licensing requirements for virtualized apps on Large Citrix implementation. 7/7/17 - sent ghostwritten message to client for request of as-is quotes.   6/30 - Discovery meeting attended by John, Stephen and Anthony, which was a lighter audience than expected, but had very good dialogue and ran way over time. 6/23 - Confusion around the Discovery meeting, slated for next week now, however still awaiting final server information. 6/16: discovery mtg 6/29 - awaiting details fro client so we can perform calcs and analysis. 6/01/17 - Completed interviews and received final documents.  Still need final server numbers for Windows/Systems Center for Discovery Report and initial 'As Is' estimate and working to schedule Discovery meeting. 5/12/2017 - Same as last week, no material progress as of yet. 5/5/2017 - Had bi-weekly call and discussed project timeline, questionnaire deadline and next steps.  Also lots of Q&A and coaching on preparation. 4/28:  Client happy. Meeting was a waste.  Really wanted a meet and greet with the team.  Better to have tied it to a deliverable event.  4/21:  On-site on Tuesday for strategy discussion and planning the approach to MSFT.  4/7:  Surprised that their executive was trying to close 9 mos. before expiration.  Trying to delay on-site so not to disrupt other deals. 3/31:  Held kickoff.  Good start, especially with John Ng.  3/24:  Kickoff next week.  3/17/2017 - Official kickoff being scheduled for next week or the week after. 3/10/2017 - No major update to report, working on kickoff date once John is back. 3/3/17 - Drafted project plan for John Nguyen, hoping to have kickoff next week or week after.",

        "description": "Msft EA Renewal, part of subscription.  We spent near a year working on Discovery, with many options and and a lot of planning.  We even uncovered numerous non-compliant situations and provided specific advice on how to rectify.  The customer was very interested in O365 as a potential option, but getting the right discount and pricing was very important.  Of course, they were very concerned with security as well, but once they got past that concern it was a solid decision to move forward with an O365 option.  Unfortunately Grace was waiting in the wings to take over and pull NPI out for the final rounds.  She was frustrated with MSFT's resistance to her strategy, but her boss ended up coming back to us, along with John Ngyuen, and seeking our advice and benchmarking for the final rounds.  Ultimately they got a good deal, it could have been better if they would have followed our advice, but as we found out, Grace wanted to discontinue our relationship and even went as far as to say that they know as much as NPI and don't need any of our benchmarking any longer.  Also that they are premier negotiators now.",

Final ELA was at 80%+ as well. See attached email with feedback and Steve's reply about progress to date.  Response when I sent feedback: Thank you, this is insightful and scary.. Charles and I will review, while we are waiting on a response from SAS on MLA discount terms we believe we have locked in as we discussed. SAS promised yesterday, Bob Mann reached out again this morning, still nothing.   Lastly, I reached out to BU with EM questions, and he is traveling and did not have access to some data in order to answer. Expecting a response there as well. I?m pretty comfortable it?s for 16 core, but not sure if it?s per client..",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Kronos and found the pricing for the core SaaS bundle to be above Fair Market Value (FMV) with room for improvement of up to 24% based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the other add-on software subscriptions are at FMV.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions. ?\tThe core SaaS bundle is priced at $2.74 per employee, per month (PEPM). The list pricing for this bundle is $7 PEPM, which is an increase from the previous list price of $5 PEPM.  o\tFor 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $1.82 PEPM. This translates to savings of $13,800 per month. ?\tThe Workforce Activities software is priced at $0.45 PEPM. This price is at Fair Market Value (FMV). ?\tThe Workforce Accruals software is priced at $0.26, which is also at FMV. ?\t The Workforce Record Manager is priced at $0.15. For 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $0.11 PEPM. This translates to savings of $600 per month. ?\tWF Analytics is priced at $0.86 PEPM. This price is FMV. ?\tThe overall savings based on NPI?s recommended target price translates to $14,400 per month and $358,560 for the 36-month period with a 24-month ramp up.  Other considerations: ?\tNPI has not seen Kronos insist on prepayment for the subscriptions. This is certainly negotiable. ?\tHowever, NPI has also not seen Kronos concede to a ramp up pricing, which reduces the revenue in years 1 and 2.  o\tMost SaaS vendors prefer an even annual or front-loaded pricing/revenue model and a 3-5 year commitment.  A ramp up licensing scenario inevitably results in higher pricing per license for the customer and higher TCO over 5 years. However, if a customer has strong leverage (for example, if the customer already has perpetual licenses and does not need the licenses since they don?t require upgrades, and therefore would not be likely to make the purchase at all, or if there is competition in the mix), the vendor will concede to these terms. ?\tA target of $2 per employee per month for Time and Accruals for 15,000 employees is achievable. The motivation by Kronos to provide a larger incentive for a large employee base is in line with their marketing approach, which highly touts the number of users/employees that use or are managed through KRONOS cloud. ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially on the add-on subscriptions.",

        "current_narrative": "Progressive is accustomed to receiving best-in-class pricing for Dell EMC products and this proposal falls slightly short, despite including some considerable concessions. However, the discounts provided by EMC are still higher than the majority of EMC purchases that NPI reviews, and attaining further discounts will require careful negotiation.   Pricing Analysis NPI?s analysis incorporates 15 separate proposals. The methodology for this analysis categorizes each proposed line item into a specific EMC product ?family? (Centera, Data Domain, VxRack, etc.) and category (HW, SW, PS, Maint.), as discounting levels between different storage families and categories vary within the Dell EMC environment.  Because NPI data revolves around EMC product families and  because the fair discount ranges for each of these families varies, the analysis discusses discounts by family and category and concludes with target recommendations per each individual quote.  CENTERA ?\tCentera spend is 3% of the overall proposal spend, which is in line with industry observations of decreasing spend on this product family. o\tNPI continues to see clients migrating from this platform to more current offerings from EMC and/or other vendors. ?\tThe current proposal is discounted at 68% off list price for HW. NPI finds this pricing to be at FMV with room for improvement.  A discount target of 72% off list pricing would place Progressive in the best-in-class range.   Achieving this target will result in a savings of $16,342. ?\tNPI has seen some instances where it was difficult for clients to migrate from this platform.  Some migrations have been complex, and when issues arise, there are few Centera ?experts? remaining on the Dell EMC team to resolve problems. ?\tNPI has observed ?creative? pricing solutions where clients can achieve extremely deep discounts when bundling a planned migration/retirement of the Centera platform to a newer EMC offering.  These types of ?solutions? allow for a win-win scenario where the client can upgrade the platform, EMC can migrate off an older platform which is increasingly more difficult to support, and the sales team can deepen the EMC relationship with new products.  NPI recommends a careful ROI analysis on any new solutions proposed.  DATA DOMAIN ?\tEMC currently offers a 64% discount off list for both HW and Maintenance on the Data Domain (DD) family of products.  NPI finds this to be a low discount that places pricing above FMV. ?\tThe prior Data Domain purchase had a discount of 69% on a net price of $83K.  Current net pricing of $611K has a smaller, 64% discount off list.   ?\tA target of 69% to match prior discounting levels for this family of product will result in a savings of $89K.  ELASTIC CLOUD STORAGE (ECS) ?\tEMC offers discounts of 34.2% on their Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) product.  NPI finds this discount level to be too low, and pricing therefore too high given the deep relationship that Progressive has with EMC.   ?\tThis appears to be the initial entry point for this product family, which focuses on Software Defined Storage (SDS) for a turnkey, hyperscale storage infrastructure.  The current buy represents 14%, or $700K, of the current spend and spend in this family will likely grow in the future. ?\tNPI has seen discounts at the 40% level for a handful of clients.  As the Progressive relationship and spend continues to grow, NPI would expect nothing less than a discount of 40% in this area.  Achieving the 40% discount target will establish a solid discounting framework from which to baseline future purchases and will also result in savings of $62K on this purchase.  VBLOCK / VxBLOCK ?\tVBlock spend in this proposal appears to be maintenance-related spend of $230K that is not discounted. ?\tNPI finds that EMC maintenance spend is rarely discounted and pre-defined by EMC at the time of purchase (as it is based on the purchase price). ?\tNPI finds pricing to be within FMV for this renewal. VMAX ?\tNPI routinely observes Core VMAX purchases reach the high 70% and even low 80% discount ranges depending on size of purchase.  ?\tVMAX is one of two ?flagship products for EMC that they built from the ground up, but the platform has existed for some time and EMC?s margins have steadily grown.  ?\tNPI assumes that Progressive was able to reach (and exceed) the prior discount target of 80%, as prior discounting for Progressive was at 68% in December 2016.  Achieving that prior target of 80% would have yielded savings of $1.175M. ?\tProgressive is currently at 81% and NPI is confident that the current discounting for this family is at best-in-class pricing.   ?\tEMC traditionally applies discounts for all portions of software, hardware, and support at the same discount levels.  NPI typically finds elevated discounts in all areas Professional Services. ?\tEMC Professional Services are custom and customer-specific; engagement prices are priced by teams per business units. There is also little to no continuity across business units.  NPI rarely sees pricing concessions in this area.    Hardware Support and Warranty Upgrade OPTIONS:  ?\tWhile it is widely distributed and acknowledged that VMAX hardware comes with 3 years of support at the time of purchase, this support is Basic Support, or 24/7 remote support, with NBD delivery of replacements.  ?\tOf course, there is an upgraded level of support or Premium Support and, depending on the size of the purchase, this ?upgrade support? will either carry the same level of discounting as the hardware that it is providing coverage for or include it entirely.  o\tThe little-known or unknown side of support is that the 4th year can be included at the basic level for ?free? and at the same discount level for upgrade support, with no penalty or commission knock to the EMC Enterprise AM or Sales Team selling it.  VRACK / VxRACK ?\tProgressive had originally submitted two quote proposals to NPI for review.  Proposal P1112366 contained 2 sections, Prod and Non-Prod. Environments.  These two proposals were subsequently withdrawn. ?\tAlthough quote 6001450691 may need to be removed from this analysis, the PS figures associated with this quote are still included in this report.  As all VxRack charges are specifically broken into categorical spend, it will be relatively simple to remove the PS amount of $751,273 if necessary.  XTREMIO ?\tXtremIO is offered at a 64% discount for the majority of HW SKUs in this family.  Support is also offered at 64% off list pricing. This discount is too low and places pricing above FMV. NPI recommends a target discount of 72% to bring these items within FMV. o\tA single SKU that stands out in the XtremIO analysis is the InfiniBand Switch.  This switch was only discounted at 48.7%.  NPI believes this hardware should be discounted to the same discount rate as all other XtremIO HW. ?\tNPI has recently seen smaller deals achieve the 69% discount target at the $200K price point.  NPI believes that the significant spend with EMC should warrant best-in-class pricing and discounting for this product family. ?\tAs previously noted for the two maturing family lines above, the all-flash, high IO product offering by EMC is seen as a technology class that will continue to grow within the Progressive environment. Therefore, we strongly recommend that Progressive establish a solid discounting baseline for this product.  Achieving the targeted discount of 72% will result in savings of $230K. Negotiation Leverage and Strategy ?\tIt is NPI?s understanding that Progressive ?isn?t looking for ?deeper? discounting, but rather...for discounting that appreciates the deepening relationship that [they] have with EMC.? ?\tNPI recommends that Progressive stress that, as the EMC / Progressive relationship continues to strengthen and grow, Progressive would like to see the same discounting as previously offered by EMC.   ?\tOverall, targeted discounts are based on best-in-class pricing that Progressive has previously witnessed in prior purchases.",

        "description": "Hi Karen,  I have four sets of quotes that I need NPI to review for November deals. Let me know if you need additional information or if you would like me to contact Greg directly on these.   These sets are all EMC deals for storage  and virtual computing infrastructure.   Project 1 ? HCI infrastructure for DSE project  Project 2 ? vBlock Lease Extension for Prod and Non-prod racks  Project 3 ? Centera Evaluation Units purchase  Project 4 ? Q4 Storage Purchase (multi-platform)    Hi Chris, We?ve got a lot going on and I just was able to take a first pass.  ?\tThe first two files are VCE quotes with the same look and feel and list prices includes.  Reviewing won?t be a problem.  ?\tThe third and fourth files are one line item quotes in a standard EMC file format.  Not big dollars but no list price and a generic SKU.  These can?t be benchmarked in this format.  Do they relate to the VCE quotes? ?\tThe fifth file is another EMC quote.  No list prices but not a lot of items and we can fill in the blanks. ?\tThe sixth file is the biggest dollar quote.  No list prices and many worksheets.  I think it makes the most sense to ask EMC to revise with list prices. There?s even a column for it that they left blank. On prior NPI reviews for Progressive for EMC they furnished it.  This is the most efficient and accurate way to proceed.  Can you request that?  Can you share any info on timeline and context?  We reviewed another sizable purchase in December.  Would be interesting to understand how this relates to that purchase.   Try these quotes. The timeframe for these transactions are all in the next three weeks. The context is: the storage transactions are mostly to replace end of life units for the big storage quote, additional emergency capacity for the Centera storage, lease extension on the vblock units, and a new development/ production environment for the Prod/Non-Prod racks.    OUTCOME EMAIL (NO DOCS): EMC tends to bundle product and services with the greater discounts coming on services and associated software, at least for Progressive. On the vxblock / vxRail deal there was no appreciable additional discount received for this deal. We did receive services discounts in the amount of $125k tied to this purchase. On the storage deal (XtemeIO, Vmax, Data Domain, Centera) we received a total of $549k in software discounts and software substitution rights on a total spend of $3.027M for this purchase.   As we look toward renegotiating our current ELA with Dell EMC we will be seeking more favorable discounts rates across the board for HW, SW, and Services for the next term. We are clear that we left money on the table in the prior contract.",

With a current blended discount of 65.7%, VSP is within FMV, but we have seen slightly better discounting and we believe VSP should target 68% for 2,000 Nodes, returning an additional ~$6K in savings.   The message to Chef should focus on dollar figures vs discount percentages.  It is a more convincing argument to explain to Chef that you are trying to reach a budgetary number of $82,250 (using a specific number makes it seem more realistic).  You may be able to rob from Peter to pay Paul and add some additional dollars to the budget for this project, but we are unlikely to get to $94K.  If Chef can meet us in the middle around $85K, approval will likely happen quicker.  NPI is interested in the negotiations that have occurred to this point with Chef?  What has VSP done & said to reach the current 65.7% blended discount?  In sum, NPI feels this pricing is within FMV as is, but 68% is achievable and would be closer to best-in-class.",

We are not incorporating Storefront in 2018 but have requested the vendor to offer a recoup of those paid costs with the knowledge that we were not using the services in 2017.   I have attached our former agreement along with a renewal proposal for your reference.   Are you able to assist? If so, what is your expected turn around on the request?   Update - we have decided to opt for a one year deal with the assumption that our business will change over the next year. With that, we may not engage your services on this one. Due to the substantial savings we obtained on the prior agreement I don't anticipate, nor do I expect, they will be in a position offer additional savings for a one year renewal. Let me converse with Mark Wheeler first and I will get back to you.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the Oracle Fusion Financials Cloud subscription pricing and found the pricing to be within the range of Fair Market Value with room for improvement.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tOracle has offered a blended discount of 54.4% for various Oracle Financial Cloud Services.  o\tIn the past year, NPI has seen a large discount variance for Oracle Cloud products in general and particularly for the EPM and Financial stacks. o\t NPI has seen discounts vary between 20% and 86%.  o\tThe typical expected discount range for transactions of this size is 45% - 64.8%.   ?\tWhile the offered discount of 54.4% is within this market range, there is room for improvement in discounting of up to 10%.  Oracle Cloud discounts and pricing are based on factors such as:  ?\tQuantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customer prior to purchasing the cloud subscription (Oracle provides big incentives when customers are moving from perpetual to cloud licenses, including shelving credits, credits for prepaid maintenance and larger discounts on the cloud products) ?\tCustomer requirements and negotiation leverage ?\tPresence of competitors ?\tSenior Management/CXO level connects/escalations  ?\tVolume and total spend with Oracle  Oracle?s Cloud Strategy  Oracle is in a full-court press to move as many customers to the Cloud as possible, even though over 70% of their revenue is still from their on-premise install base.  They are \"all-in\" on the Cloud and are paying their field reps (ASMs) on cloud-only revenue.  Last year, they gave their field ASMs a small SPIFF for on-premise software sales and have moved all of their on-premise sales efforts over to their inside sales group, OracleDirect.   Oracle Pricing/discounting Strategy on Cloud Products  As mentioned earlier, NPI has observed large variances in discounting for Oracle cloud products, but overall, Oracle has been much more conservative from a discount perspective on their SaaS offerings. Typically, any discount for a SaaS tool that is over 65% must be personally reviewed by the SVP of Sales for North America         through a deal review call; historically, very few transactions over 65% have been approved.  There are exceptions to this, of course, but exceptions must be a monster deal and very strategic, an ELA or otherwise.  This is one of the reasons H&R Block has previously received discount quotes for 64%.  It's unlikely that Oracle will go any higher than a 64.9% discount, even if you threaten to walk from the deal (although that may get them to consider).",

This will provide further negotiation leverage if VSP can pull the trigger quickly.  o\tVSP?s message should be: ?The budget for this project has been cut to $40K.

        "current_narrative": "Pat My advisor believes the Equinix offers are at list price for both Chicago and DC.   The DC 2 data center is their main hub and there?s not much remaining space there which makes them less negotiable.  Chicago is another story.  List pricing is above FMV.  Target 25-30% off all MRCs and settling on anything about 20% is solid plus target no installation costs in Chicago.  While you may want to push for that in DC it?ll be tougher.  You may want to consider indicating you know DC is their hub and your intel suggests has limited capacity and because of that you can live with minimal discounting BUT 0% across the board is not going to work.  Then push for 10% on DC and the targets I noted for Chicago.  This is new business for Equinix with cheaper options so they can flex if pushed.  A few other thoughts:  There are two power models in the industry.  Measured Use (pay by amp used) and flat rated to a limit.  AmFam has chosen kVA based power which has flat rated AC power to a 3 KVa limit per term. There are significant penalties if you exceed the kVa limit during the 36 month term.  AmFam needs to understand the initial consumption of the equipment going in to the cabinet and its future growth.  See below on contractual items.  The NRC cost for each AC circuit is $500.  Power is primary and redundant so a total of 4 circuits.    Power                   NRC                       MRC (primary & redundant) Chicago                $500.00                 $362.50/cabinet                                $1,087.50/cage Ashburn               $500.00                 $300.00/cabinet                                $900.00/cage                        Interconnection Each cage will be configured with a 10 gb port accessible to the public internet/cloud.  NRC is $3,000 per port.  This a bundled offer including the port and cross-connect and cable.   There is no mention of redundancy in the port.    Potential Risks  1]            Make sure 3 cabinets and 3 kVa is sufficient for the 36 month term of the contract.    2]            Make sure the interconnection port is redundant. We assume one IBX location is primary and the other DR.  3]            This is not a fixed price contract.  There is a 5% annual price escalator on all prices.     TCO Summary                                 NRC                       36 months          Total  Chicago                 $5,500                   $89,846                 $95,346  Ashburn               $5,500                   $75,660                 $81,160  Total                      $11,000                 $165,506              $176,506   Here are three other ideas for AmFam to consider:  1]           Reduce the 5% fixed annual escalator:   Eliminate/reduce the escalator on the cage MRC of $300 (Ashburn) and $362 (Chicago).  Equinix space costs are fixed (investment in the building is sunk).  Plus, they keep adding cabinets so they cover their costs at the marginal rate of another cabinet.  This is very similar to another software license?no increase in underlying cost but increased revenue.   Second, on the other hand, power is an external variable not completely under their control.   In that case, I would index the power to a third party index.  I used the CPI index.   BLS publishes CPI values on urban basis and both Chicago and Washington have their own index.  Equinix will have language available for indexing and AmFam should ask for it and compare 5% to what they propose as an index.   National CPI over the last 3 years is much lower than 5% annually.    2]           Up front $3000 interconnection fee:  The old model was a monthly interconnect charge which has been replaced through competition to a NRC.  A interconnection MRC was ?frustrating? as it was viewed by the customer as a charge for a 50 foot piece of cable (I?m exaggerating here).  Amortized over the 36 month term, this works out to $83 MRC for a 10 gb port with no traffic charge.  This is a good price but AmFam needs to ask what the charge will be to use Equinix services to interconnect with cloud providers (say Azure, AWS, etc) or a third party ISP (say AT&T, VZ) for internet access.   So, make sure the port is redundant and make sure you understand third party external interconnect costs.  The port is a gate to the outside world?..charges for what goes through the gate may be additional.  3]           Hedge for growth:  Three cabinets/cage seems small, but maybe that?s all AmFam can forecast right now.   Consider including a hedge this way.  Reserve on a no-cost basis 2 additional cabinets per cage (build the cage larger).  If they grow past the initial 3 cabinets anytime during the term, they can draw down on the 2 reserved cabinets.  All cabinets will then have a reduction in MRC by some negotiated MRC.  AmFam is working with a small requirement so Equinix probably will not want to negotiate this (if they don?t grow, Equinix has 2 stranded cabinet spaces).   AmFam nevertheless should reserve and hedge now to the best you can.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed Freddie Mac?s SCE pricing and found it to be above fair market value (FMV) based on comparable Microsoft spends. Discounting is poor in each category for a $2M+ annual spend, and the 0% discount on subscription items is consistent with a 0% rate on subscriptions in Freddie Mac?s larger EAS. The SCE does provide some automatic discounting on perpetual licensing, but at this size of a net spend across multiple agreements, those discounts do not push pricing into the range of FMV.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI strongly recommends not mentioning specific discounts off the Level C reference pricing.  Microsoft is notorious for standing up to requests that solely revolve around discounts; they are typically much more receptive when clients speak to the larger 3-year TCO plus address the financial exposure risks of the SCE?s encompassing licensing rules. ?\tNPI recommends getting Microsoft to focus on an even budgetary goal of getting the spend under a $6.75M target for the term ($2.25M annual) in exchange for an expedited deal approval that preserves a March signature timeline. ?\tNPI notes that these targets are more conservative to reflect the smaller timeframe available for this deal.  o\tMore aggressive targets would be appropriate with multiple months available for negotiations, but NPI has seen success even within shorter periods.  o\tIf Freddie Mac feels the sales team is especially nervous about landing this deal, it is feasible to pursue a more aggressive price target.",

We will be selecting a technology solution to replace the existing Cisco 891 router, the ASR1004 head end gear, and the existing inline NAC solution.  In addition, we will be deploying wireless LAN to all of the Agent offices.  AmFam will be selecting a vendor to procure the equipment and deploy the technology solution.  At the conclusion of the RFP process we will award a contract.  Additional Information: AmFam has 3,000 agent offices throughout 19 states that will be affected.  We desire to implement a reasonable security protection capability within each office, however, we would like to retain the current Netgear FS728 switches deployed in each office.  Long term, we expect the Netgear will be phased out as we move to a predominantly wireless office.  Use of Aruba ClearPass is desired as the back end authentication system. We want to use a client or dissolvable agent to provide AmFam device posture checks.",

        "current_narrative": "In summary, the proposed pricing from Adobe is at the low end of the range of Fair Market Value as compared to similar market transactions.  NPI reviewed the original Adobe Analytics purchase for Intuit (In June 2016).  Adobe had proposed pricing of $28 for 90 Billion server calls and $25 for 100 Billion server calls per year. NPI had recommended targets of $25 for 90 billion server calls and $23 for 100 billion server calls which targets Intuit achieved at the time resulting in savings of $233K for 1 year.  In a subsequent renewal early last year, the pricing has remained flat at $23 for 100 Billion server calls.  Adobe Analytics Changes   Adobe previously offered Analytics in two editions, standard and premium.  ?\tAdobe has repackaged the Analytics Cloud (announced March 2017) and now offers three editions: Select, Prime and Ultimate. The license metric continues to be Million SERVER CALLS Per Month. Each product increases in functionality and price from Select to Prime to Ultimate. ?\tPreviously, secondary calls cost 50% of Primary server calls, but that is no longer the case. Now, both primary and secondary calls have the same cost and count towards the total calls. ?\tAdobe increased the price for all of their analytics solutions this year when they introduced the three new analytics products. ?\tBased on Intuit's usage of Adobe Analytics and price point, Intuit has been offered the Prime product for this renewal.  Price Breakdown     ?\tIt is common for Adobe to offer pricing tiers like the offered table for companies to project their spend as they grow.  Typically Adobe will offer 3 options - they have offered seven options in this proposal, which is generous.   ?\tIntuit is being offered great pricing on Adobe Analytics Prime. This pricing is likely to have had not only management exception approval but also executive approval. Intuit?s Adobe rep likely had to fight a battle internally to get this pricing approved.    Recommendation ?\tOverall, NPI believes that Intuit has received great pricing from Adobe for the Analytics Prime and the pricing has remained flat since 2016/2017.  ?\tThe Sitecat Data Feed is priced at $1,350 CPMM. NPI recommends a pricing of $1250 CPMM which translates to savings of $14,400 per year. ?\tAt this level of spend, Intuit can request free training and free passes to Adobe Summit.  FINAL UPDATE: Great news, we were able to negotiate our pricing further to 21.25 for 120B primary server calls (price intended for 150B) and continue to pay 11.50 for secondary postponing the increase in price for secondary. Thank you!",

ServiceNow continues to develop new offerings, and although CRL only anticipates the two license types, NPI expects the vendor will try to upsell different areas of your organization. If CRL considers adding any products to this proposal, NPI suggests using that additional demand as a point of leverage by positioning them as ?nice-to-haves? that could be left off due to cost considerations. ServiceNow?s next fiscal quarter end is this month (March), and CRL?s offer to ServiceNow could provide key incentives to sales team quotas.",

ServiceNow is notorious for standing up to requests that solely revolve around discounts; they are typically much more receptive when clients speak to the long-term solution TCO, especially as it relates to pricing allowing for growth and new products.   ?\tNPI recommends getting ServiceNow to focus on getting the combined spend under an even $325K target annually in exchange for an expedited deal approval that can accommodate a March signature timeline.

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed Freddie Mac?s SCE pricing and found it to be above fair market value (FMV) based on comparable Microsoft spends. Discounting is poor in each category for a $2M+ annual spend, and the 0% discount on subscription items is consistent with a 0% rate on subscriptions in Freddie Mac?s larger EAS. The SCE does provide some automatic discounting on perpetual licensing, but at this size of a net spend across multiple agreements, those discounts do not push pricing into the range of FMV.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI strongly recommends not mentioning specific discounts off the Level C reference pricing.  Microsoft is notorious for standing up to requests that solely revolve around discounts; they are typically much more receptive when clients speak to the larger 3-year TCO plus address the financial exposure risks of the SCE?s encompassing licensing rules. ?\tNPI recommends getting Microsoft to focus on an even budgetary goal of getting the spend under a $6.75M target for the term ($2.25M annual) in exchange for an expedited deal approval that preserves a March signature timeline. ?\tNPI notes that these targets are more conservative to reflect the smaller timeframe available for this deal.  o\tMore aggressive targets would be appropriate with multiple months available for negotiations, but NPI has seen success even within shorter periods.  o\tIf Freddie Mac feels the sales team is especially nervous about landing this deal, it is feasible to pursue a more aggressive price target.",

        "current_narrative": "Findings and Recommendations NPI reviewed REI?s Kronos proposal and found the pricing for the add-on software subscriptions to be Fair Market Value (FMV) based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the ?Professional and Educational Services? were noted to be Above FMV.  Pricing Analysis ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions.   Workforce Budgeting & Analytics Kronos has a large footprint at REI, but even in the context of larger spend the pricing is very good and appears historical pricing has carried to the current proposal before contract consolidation next year. ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be FMV.  o\tWhile Kronos does not publish list pricing, NPI has numerous deals in our database providing the ability to make comparisons, and by our estimates, your quote is discounted at ~80%+ which NPI considers to be solidly FMV. ?\tMarket range is typically between $.8 and $1.5 so clearly REI is getting solid pricing given these are add-on purchases.

Kronos rack rates start at $200 per hour (blended). ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be Above FMV. ?\tCurrently, your blended hourly rate stands at ~$213, which we would expect for someone with far less of a landscape than what REI has. o\tNPI provided target discounts as shown in the table below, returning a nominal additional savings of $1,078 (blended rate of ~$180).  SOW - Role\tHours\tRate\tExtended\tDiscount\tTarget Discount\tTarget Price\tTarget Savings Project Manager\t4\t$200\t$800\t0%\t10%\t$720\t$80 Technical Consultant\t29\t$215\t$6,235\t0%\t16%\t$5,237\t$998 \t\t\t$7,035\t\t15%\t\t$1,078  Negotiation Leverage and Strategy ?\tNPI recommends REI to express disappointment with these rates. Indicate that you have done your market research (talking to colleagues, or a new REI executive who has experience with Kronos consulting), and you were expecting a blended rate closer to $175 - $180 per hour and to match prior contracts.  ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially for the add-on subscriptions. While that is evident in the subscription add-on, there is room for improvement on hourly rates.   Determined licenses were FMV but install rates were above FMV with targets provided",

This indicates Shaw?s need for licenses to change hands as people may leave/change departments as they no longer require access to Workfront. The Flex license is also flexible in capabilities as changing employees may not need the full use of a certain license type but is still available. Flex licenses are offered at a lower list price but with limited discounting ? most likely due to customers not always leveraging the full benefits of the higher tier (?Work? is half the cost of ?Plan? license).  o\tDoes Shaw need the flexibility? As it does come at a cost - it can makes sense to use Flex if you have more Work licenses than Plan. It is to Shaw?s advantage if you are able to make full use of the Flex license.  o\tIf this is not the case for Shaw?s Workfront landscape, you could inquire for a quote using one license type or the other to see how pricing compares. ?\tNPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms. We believe this longer commitment should be rewarded. o\tFor this deal size and term NPIs FMV target is 30%. FYI, we would expect a one-year term to top out at 10% and a two-year near 20%. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of $10,560.  ProofHQ Premium License ?  ?\tNPI calculated a current discount of 20% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting driven by the same reasoning as the Flex license.  We often see both types of licenses discounted similarly. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of a modest $1,700. ?\tNPI provided a comparison of Premium vs Standard below, where if Shaw does not require the Premium benefits you could consider the lower cost Standard or Select offerings. Shaw could consider the threat or really consider a less expensive license. o\tSee ?Pricing? section (no pricing provided, but compares license types) ? https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/workfront-review/   The Premium offering includes:  ?\tTheir highest level of license and security  ?\tEncryption-at-rest  ?\tOption to review data center audits performed to maintain SaS70 compliance  ?\tUnlimited access to providing Requests, Dashboards and Reports ? users beyond the licensed ?Power users?  ?\tHighest level of support, 7X24X365  ?\tProvides for data storage of 25GB per user ?\tHighest level of SLA at 30 Min ? 4 hours  The Standard offering by comparison:  ?\tDoes not include their highest security, Encryption-at-rest (EAR)  ?\tProvides for their lowest level of SLA?s (2 hours - 2 business days for support response)  ?\tProvides their lowest level of support offering 12 hours per day, 5 days per week (12X5)  ?\tProvides for data storage of 1.5GB per user  ?\tSomewhat limited where non-power users are unable to submit requests to a queue.

        "customer_comments": "***Updated proposal received with new feedback provided. See the attached files labeled 'UPDATED...'  While the Flex license quantities have remained the same (55), Shaw has been proposed a more expensive ?Enterprise Flex License? ? reflecting a list price increase of 50% from the previous $1,200 unit list to the current $1,800 unit list price. ?\tThe ?Workfront Enterprise Flex License? was previously offered as the ?Workfront Flex-Planned Work License?. This improved license offers expanded functionalities, granting users access to all features of the application including standard work management, resource planning, proofing, reporting, etc. o\tIt is to Shaw?s advantage to make full use of the Flex license as you are paying for the ability to use both license types.  In consideration of the increase in overall spend and 3 year contract term, NPI views current pricing as Above FMV. NPI suggests targeting a discount of 35% with reasonable fallback of 25% to 30%.  ?\tSimilar to before, NPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms.

This will provide further negotiation leverage if VSP can pull the trigger quickly.  o\tVSP?s message should be: ?The budget for this project has been cut to $40K.

ServiceNow customers face many challenges that are common with enterprise SaaS providers. The solution can grow rapidly and the vendor is notorious for levying heavy automatic price hikes if left unchecked.  ServiceNow continues to develop new offerings, and although CRL only anticipates the two license types, NPI expects the vendor will try to upsell different areas of your organization. If CRL considers adding any products to this proposal, NPI suggests using that additional demand as a point of leverage by positioning them as ?nice-to-haves? that could be left off due to cost considerations. ServiceNow?s next fiscal quarter end is this month (March), and CRL?s offer to ServiceNow could provide key incentives to sales team quotas.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI strongly recommends not mentioning specific discounts.  ServiceNow is notorious for standing up to requests that solely revolve around discounts; they are typically much more receptive when clients speak to the long-term solution TCO, especially as it relates to pricing allowing for growth and new products.   ?\tNPI recommends getting ServiceNow to focus on getting the combined spend under an even $325K target annually in exchange for an expedited deal approval that can accommodate a March signature timeline.

        "current_narrative": "Provided feedback via email (see attached)  Thanks for sending over the quote for our review. NPI has provided general feedback as well as specific price targets for your 3-year renewal.  They changed the company name from AtTask to Workfront (http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/attask-changes-its-name-to-workfront-inc-300023764.html) in 2015 to rebrand and grow. Workfront has been aggressive, raising prices significantly over the past several years.  ?\tWorkfront acquired ProofHQ in 2015 (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/workfront-acquires-proofhq-300116669.html)  While Workfront does not publish list pricing, they have provided it in Shaw?s quote (see table below for math).  Workfront Flex License ?  ?\tThe ?Flex? License allows for Workfront customers to seamlessly transfer access within an organization, not always offered by account executives as it is a cross between the highest tier ?Plan? license (all inclusive) and lower tier ?Work? license (less inclusive). This indicates Shaw?s need for licenses to change hands as people may leave/change departments as they no longer require access to Workfront. The Flex license is also flexible in capabilities as changing employees may not need the full use of a certain license type but is still available. Flex licenses are offered at a lower list price but with limited discounting ? most likely due to customers not always leveraging the full benefits of the higher tier (?Work? is half the cost of ?Plan? license).  o\tDoes Shaw need the flexibility? As it does come at a cost - it can makes sense to use Flex if you have more Work licenses than Plan. It is to Shaw?s advantage if you are able to make full use of the Flex license.  o\tIf this is not the case for Shaw?s Workfront landscape, you could inquire for a quote using one license type or the other to see how pricing compares. ?\tNPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms. We believe this longer commitment should be rewarded. o\tFor this deal size and term NPIs FMV target is 30%. FYI, we would expect a one-year term to top out at 10% and a two-year near 20%. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of $10,560.  ProofHQ Premium License ?  ?\tNPI calculated a current discount of 20% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting driven by the same reasoning as the Flex license.  We often see both types of licenses discounted similarly. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of a modest $1,700. ?\tNPI provided a comparison of Premium vs Standard below, where if Shaw does not require the Premium benefits you could consider the lower cost Standard or Select offerings. Shaw could consider the threat or really consider a less expensive license. o\tSee ?Pricing? section (no pricing provided, but compares license types) ? https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/workfront-review/   The Premium offering includes:  ?\tTheir highest level of license and security  ?\tEncryption-at-rest  ?\tOption to review data center audits performed to maintain SaS70 compliance  ?\tUnlimited access to providing Requests, Dashboards and Reports ? users beyond the licensed ?Power users?  ?\tHighest level of support, 7X24X365  ?\tProvides for data storage of 25GB per user ?\tHighest level of SLA at 30 Min ? 4 hours  The Standard offering by comparison:  ?\tDoes not include their highest security, Encryption-at-rest (EAR)  ?\tProvides for their lowest level of SLA?s (2 hours - 2 business days for support response)  ?\tProvides their lowest level of support offering 12 hours per day, 5 days per week (12X5)  ?\tProvides for data storage of 1.5GB per user  ?\tSomewhat limited where non-power users are unable to submit requests to a queue.

        "customer_comments": "***Updated proposal received with new feedback provided. See the attached files labeled 'UPDATED...'  While the Flex license quantities have remained the same (55), Shaw has been proposed a more expensive ?Enterprise Flex License? ? reflecting a list price increase of 50% from the previous $1,200 unit list to the current $1,800 unit list price. ?\tThe ?Workfront Enterprise Flex License? was previously offered as the ?Workfront Flex-Planned Work License?. This improved license offers expanded functionalities, granting users access to all features of the application including standard work management, resource planning, proofing, reporting, etc. o\tIt is to Shaw?s advantage to make full use of the Flex license as you are paying for the ability to use both license types.  In consideration of the increase in overall spend and 3 year contract term, NPI views current pricing as Above FMV. NPI suggests targeting a discount of 35% with reasonable fallback of 25% to 30%.  ?\tSimilar to before, NPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms.

We have only seen a handful of BrightEdge transactions, but I was able to do some comparative analysis on the discount percentage.  Overall, last year?s purchase at 40% discounting is well within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV) for a BrightEdge purchase of this size.  We have actually seen a few larger BrightEdge deals that have maxed out in the mid- 40%?s discounting, so we consider 40% for a $60K list price purchase to be FMV.  Since BrightEdge has held the pricing flat AND included additional Domains and Google Analytics connects, NPI continues to believe that this pricing is well within FMV.  VSP can move forward with confidence on this one.",

        "current_narrative": "Robert, Hey there.  Must be something about this space and how their vendors conceal their list prices.  I guess as security companies they are practicing what they preach ?.  While we?ve seen several Vormetric deals the SKUs often vary across our reviews and they don?t always show list pricing.  However, they do at times so we know they will provide it if asked.  Again, we got resourceful and tried to work through this and also leverage some public data.  I just got to a point where I think we are better off asking Trace3 to show add more transparency in their quote.  I think the SKUs are correct so that?s some good news.  The attached Excel file shows the work in progress.  I haven?t suggested targets yet since there?s too many open items.  Of note:  ?\tVOR-TE ? listed for $6K about 12 months ago.  Let?s confirm this.  You may also want to take this time and ask about the bundled list price (and even net) that includes the Transparent Encryption Agent, Application Encryption and Tokenization. Another client bought the bundle (at MUCH bigger volumes ? 1,500) but paid $1K for each bundle. Webster is at $3,150 for just TE. You?re at less than 2% of their volume but I?m curious what they?d offer and it may be good to know if that?s on your roadmap.  If only two of these are of interest I don?t think they have a bundle for that but you could ask.  This other client didn?t have the Tokenization Client license so perhaps they?re configuring their solution differently than Webster. o\tThe quantity of 25 for VOR-TE and VOR-VTE-LTD brings up another topic to push for clarity on. From the limited pricing I?ve seen there?s a clear example on their Data Encryption Agent license where the first one is $6K, ten cost $45K (or $4500 each) and 25 cost $100K or $4K each).  I think now is the time to make sure they show you what all these tiers look like to ensure you?re getting both the programmatic volume discount and the additional discount you?d get on a first-time competitive buy. ?\tVOR-VTE-LTD ? the one item I had no traction finding list pricing for ?\tVOR-TOKEN ? educated guess is this is also at $6K list ?\tThe DSM Enterprise Parts I believe have the same list and they just discount non-prod more than prod.  The list could be $30K or something north of $40K.  That reflects quite a swing in discounting so it is a key item to validate.  I?d be appreciative if you could also ask them for the list price of the physical DSM Enterprise equivalent. Perhaps you could say someone asked about that option and you wanted to understand it more.  I think it lists for at least $5K more. ?\tOn the Support side, Standard is always 18% of net and Premium is 22%.  We?ve never seen Premium+ which is what?s reflected on your quote.  Below is a picture of the comparison of these two in their SW Lic Agreement.  They?re offering the + at 23% of the total hardware and software net.  Doesn?t sound like a bad uplift over Premium assuming you?re getting something more.  Consider your options there.  ?\tSome services details are shown. o\tVormetric?s rack rate is $2,500/day. VOR-PRO-SERV is the SKU.  We?ve seen it not discounted typically.   o\tProgram Review and Roadmap Dev seems like it?ll be work done by Trace3 for a fixed fee of $51,800. They mention a Security Architect and PM. No hours are mentioned.   We?d expect this to reflect some hourly estimate applied against the rates and then a 10-20% uplift for the risk involved with a fixed fee engagement.  Maybe ask about a T&M to get exposure to the rates and effort. o\tProduct Install appears to be Vormetric people.  Offered at $12,500 that?s 5 days at their $2,500 rack rate.  That number of days doesn?t seem bloated.  In a competitive environment feels like that could be something to push for free. o\tTech Design and Impl - $67,500 for 6 weeks. That?s $11,250 a week or $2,250 a day if one resource which is exactly 10% off the Vormetric daily rack rate of $2500. It includes an Architect, Engineer and PM but again is offered at a fixed amount so no effort/hours noted.  Push for some clarity around this.  Is this Trace3 or Vormetric. On the one hand you?d expect a lower rate with Trace3 but oftentimes partners bring more senior resources to bear than the OEM/Publisher. o\tRoadmap and Mentoring is offered at $51,800 and is T&M. It is largely an architect at $300.  We can benchmark this.  Is this Trace3 or Vormetric.  We?ll work on what we can but let me know if you expect to reach out to Trace3 for this additional detail.  Now is the time and no reason to spend this money if there?s any questions about the transparency of the offer.  Also, do you expect future growth.  Getting transparency now sets you up for that.",
        "customer_comments": "Went with Vormetric.  Final quote increased in size largely due to Token Server Client item growing from 1 to 18.  The only reductions appear to be on the DSM units as both the Prod and non prod had reductions.  Maintenance also dropped from 23% to 20%.   The initial quotes didn't clear show all the non prod info that was shown in the final.  Estimating savings and new baseline but not overthinking it.  Future folks should use the final docs (also some list pricing in XLS) and new SME.",

From my first pass I can tell you the Trace3 (Vormetric) SOW is too light on details.  There?s a lot ($530K+) of services with no resources, rates and hours so it can?t be benchmarked.  There?s also a sizable placeholder for hardware, licenses and support for $501K with no detail.

A Jimenez MD MSED is the CEO of ImplementHIT and a $250 per hour rate for a senior consulting role is well within FMV. Market range is between $200/hour and $315/per hour.  The other resources are priced at $140 per hour which is also at Fair Market Value. Typical market range is $125 - $150 per hour. Furthermore, ImplementHIT has provided a discount of 20% on the consulting fees which makes the cost very competitive.

        "current_narrative": "Provided feedback via email (see attached)  Thanks for sending over the quote for our review. NPI has provided general feedback as well as specific price targets for your 3-year renewal.  They changed the company name from AtTask to Workfront (http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/attask-changes-its-name-to-workfront-inc-300023764.html) in 2015 to rebrand and grow. Workfront has been aggressive, raising prices significantly over the past several years.  ?\tWorkfront acquired ProofHQ in 2015 (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/workfront-acquires-proofhq-300116669.html)  While Workfront does not publish list pricing, they have provided it in Shaw?s quote (see table below for math).  Workfront Flex License ?  ?\tThe ?Flex? License allows for Workfront customers to seamlessly transfer access within an organization, not always offered by account executives as it is a cross between the highest tier ?Plan? license (all inclusive) and lower tier ?Work? license (less inclusive). This indicates Shaw?s need for licenses to change hands as people may leave/change departments as they no longer require access to Workfront. The Flex license is also flexible in capabilities as changing employees may not need the full use of a certain license type but is still available. Flex licenses are offered at a lower list price but with limited discounting ? most likely due to customers not always leveraging the full benefits of the higher tier (?Work? is half the cost of ?Plan? license).  o\tDoes Shaw need the flexibility? As it does come at a cost - it can makes sense to use Flex if you have more Work licenses than Plan. It is to Shaw?s advantage if you are able to make full use of the Flex license.  o\tIf this is not the case for Shaw?s Workfront landscape, you could inquire for a quote using one license type or the other to see how pricing compares. ?\tNPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms. We believe this longer commitment should be rewarded. o\tFor this deal size and term NPIs FMV target is 30%. FYI, we would expect a one-year term to top out at 10% and a two-year near 20%. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of $10,560.  ProofHQ Premium License ?  ?\tNPI calculated a current discount of 20% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting driven by the same reasoning as the Flex license.  We often see both types of licenses discounted similarly. o\tAchieving a target discount of 30% returns an additional savings of a modest $1,700. ?\tNPI provided a comparison of Premium vs Standard below, where if Shaw does not require the Premium benefits you could consider the lower cost Standard or Select offerings. Shaw could consider the threat or really consider a less expensive license. o\tSee ?Pricing? section (no pricing provided, but compares license types) ? https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/workfront-review/   The Premium offering includes:  ?\tTheir highest level of license and security  ?\tEncryption-at-rest  ?\tOption to review data center audits performed to maintain SaS70 compliance  ?\tUnlimited access to providing Requests, Dashboards and Reports ? users beyond the licensed ?Power users?  ?\tHighest level of support, 7X24X365  ?\tProvides for data storage of 25GB per user ?\tHighest level of SLA at 30 Min ? 4 hours  The Standard offering by comparison:  ?\tDoes not include their highest security, Encryption-at-rest (EAR)  ?\tProvides for their lowest level of SLA?s (2 hours - 2 business days for support response)  ?\tProvides their lowest level of support offering 12 hours per day, 5 days per week (12X5)  ?\tProvides for data storage of 1.5GB per user  ?\tSomewhat limited where non-power users are unable to submit requests to a queue.

        "customer_comments": "***Updated proposal received with new feedback provided. See the attached files labeled 'UPDATED...'  While the Flex license quantities have remained the same (55), Shaw has been proposed a more expensive ?Enterprise Flex License? ? reflecting a list price increase of 50% from the previous $1,200 unit list to the current $1,800 unit list price. ?\tThe ?Workfront Enterprise Flex License? was previously offered as the ?Workfront Flex-Planned Work License?. This improved license offers expanded functionalities, granting users access to all features of the application including standard work management, resource planning, proofing, reporting, etc. o\tIt is to Shaw?s advantage to make full use of the Flex license as you are paying for the ability to use both license types.  In consideration of the increase in overall spend and 3 year contract term, NPI views current pricing as Above FMV. NPI suggests targeting a discount of 35% with reasonable fallback of 25% to 30%.  ?\tSimilar to before, NPI calculated a current flat discount of 14% on your proposal, identifying an opportunity for further discounting especially considering the three-year term. Many reviews completed by NPI are for one and two year terms. We believe this longer commitment should be rewarded. o\tAchieving a target discount of 35% returns an additional savings of ~$20K. o\tAchieving a target discount of 25% returns an additional savings of ~$10K.

The majority of the spend falls under XIV storage, with XIV hardware (26%) and software (39%) comprising the majority of the spend (65%).  That ratio goes up further (71%) if Technical Advisors related to XIV are included (6%).  Analyzing hardware in this space requires greater granular configuration data for the equipment covered and can be an exacting process.  BJC?s configuration data may sway FMV analysis slightly, but there are sufficient commoditized hardware, software, and service items in the provided spreadsheet to complete a more exacting assessment.  Current price increases over the previous 5-Year term are within FMV guidelines that target anything lower than 5% annual, with BJC?s totals at nearly 4% when comparing previous and current 5-year totals.  While the overall spend is within FMV guidelines, XIV and Pseries hardware are ripe for third-party maintainers once assets are off initial support, and as a result IBM faces pricing pressure in the current market.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tBJC?s pricing is at FMV for bottom-line costs, even with increase over previous annual rates.  Addressing cost increases that did exceed 20% is the first recommended savings target, as FMV rate increase of 15% (3% per year of the previous term) are more in line with this sizable operating cost.   ?\tEquipment nearly end of life or items that may otherwise be covered by SMS can be targeted as areas for most aggressive savings expectations.  Got final doc.  Did a serial number search and compared final cost to the three year offer.  The spreadsheet had a bunch of scenarios.  Seemed like the right comparison.  Shown in Excel.

        "current_narrative": "Hi Jennifer,  Can you please clarify a couple of questions highlighted below? Thanks, I will try to get you a response back today.  To upgrade to Bot Manager Premier + Mobile SDK + Rapid Response + Client Reputation with increase in bandwidth from 75TB to 100TB = another $24K per month + a one-time $25K implementation fee. This is to cover all in scope sites (not just the current 2). How many sites total?  To increase Ion and Kona from 75TB to 100TB =  another $10K per month (with $.50 per GB overage fee) backdated to January 1. Is this $10,000 each Ion and Kona ($20,000 total)? I assume the increase is needed to cover traffic.  What is monthly traffic?  Hi Matt -   The $10K / month for extra 25TB bandwidth covers both Ion and Kona. January was about 83TB and February was also on target to exceed our 75TB entitlement. Our overage fees for January are just shy of $10K, so they will back date.  Since Digital released more products there has been an uptick in online activity (coupled with recent market volatility). We have been steadily increasing the last several months. Additionally they agreed to increase our Global Traffic Management by 30 properties at no additional cost as we exceeded those entitlements too.   (see attached email for table).  The offer for increased bandwidth on ION Premier and KSD is solid.  The push to migrate MS to Bot Manager Premier includes all of the extras that they normally throw in at no additional cost (Mobile SDK, Rapid Response, Client Reputation).  There is nothing special about this offer.  If I pulled it all together, they are proposing 100GB bandwidth and 7 sites for $46,500/month plus a $25,000 implementation fee.  A good target MRC for this arrangement anything $40,000/MRC or below.  Do you know of anyone that was able to get Akamai to agree to carry over unused bandwidth or measure overage only if over for the year or term?   For instance if I have 75TB per month, over 1 year that is 900TB. If I?m under for 9 months and go over the next, I would only pay if at end of year if I exceed 900TB.   I got them agree to count prof hours this way on our last renewal but not bandwidth.   No. I have been pushing for a more equitable equation on bandwidth usage for years.  I assume they are reluctant to do it because they lease bandwidth based on the aggregate of what they have sold and so they have a sunk cost either way.  If you are under utilizing the network, they still pay.  If you are over your commitment, they have to buy extra capacity. I?d like to get them to go on a straight metered rate.  Pay a platform fee, but then pay by the GB for actual consumption.  MS is a very large customer and has been successful in getting a lot of special terms, so you just might be the one that pushes them to a new model.  They have a sunk cost in professional hours also, but if they are sitting around idle, there are plenty of other customers to use those resources ? so in that case, there is no under utilization.",

        "description": "Hi Gregg,  NPI provided Akamai data last year before our May renewal. We?re now upgrading Bot Manager to Bot Manager Premier which we?ve been evaluating, including a Mobile SDK, Rapid Response, Client Reputation and adding Visitor Prioritization. In addition, despite all the padding we negotiated to increase bandwidth from 50TB to 75K last year, we are now exceeding our bandwidth projections and have to upgrade to 100TB. Lastly, we have to extend Session Accelerator another year as we were not able to migrate the last site to ION.   Can you provide any current data related to these services (if any)? Aside from increasing bandwidth, many of these are somewhat newer offerings.  Currently: Bot Manager Standard = Started with just MS Online @ $14K per month in Jul 2017 and added another site in Oct for a total of $22,500 per month To upgrade to Bot Manager Premier + Mobile SDK + Rapid Response + Client Reputation with increase in bandwidth from 75TB to 100TB = another $24K per month + a one-time $25K implementation fee.

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Kronos and found the pricing for the core SaaS bundle to be above Fair Market Value (FMV) with room for improvement of up to 24% based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the other add-on software subscriptions are at FMV.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions. ?\tThe core SaaS bundle is priced at $2.74 per employee, per month (PEPM). The list pricing for this bundle is $7 PEPM, which is an increase from the previous list price of $5 PEPM.  o\tFor 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $1.82 PEPM. This translates to savings of $13,800 per month. ?\tThe Workforce Activities software is priced at $0.45 PEPM. This price is at Fair Market Value (FMV). ?\tThe Workforce Accruals software is priced at $0.26, which is also at FMV. ?\t The Workforce Record Manager is priced at $0.15. For 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $0.11 PEPM. This translates to savings of $600 per month. ?\tWF Analytics is priced at $0.86 PEPM. This price is FMV. ?\tThe overall savings based on NPI?s recommended target price translates to $14,400 per month and $358,560 for the 36-month period with a 24-month ramp up.  Other considerations: ?\tNPI has not seen Kronos insist on prepayment for the subscriptions. This is certainly negotiable. ?\tHowever, NPI has also not seen Kronos concede to a ramp up pricing, which reduces the revenue in years 1 and 2.  o\tMost SaaS vendors prefer an even annual or front-loaded pricing/revenue model and a 3-5 year commitment.  A ramp up licensing scenario inevitably results in higher pricing per license for the customer and higher TCO over 5 years. However, if a customer has strong leverage (for example, if the customer already has perpetual licenses and does not need the licenses since they don?t require upgrades, and therefore would not be likely to make the purchase at all, or if there is competition in the mix), the vendor will concede to these terms. ?\tA target of $2 per employee per month for Time and Accruals for 15,000 employees is achievable. The motivation by Kronos to provide a larger incentive for a large employee base is in line with their marketing approach, which highly touts the number of users/employees that use or are managed through KRONOS cloud. ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially on the add-on subscriptions.",

        "current_narrative": "Robert, Hey there.  Must be something about this space and how their vendors conceal their list prices.  I guess as security companies they are practicing what they preach ?.  While we?ve seen several Vormetric deals the SKUs often vary across our reviews and they don?t always show list pricing.  However, they do at times so we know they will provide it if asked.  Again, we got resourceful and tried to work through this and also leverage some public data.  I just got to a point where I think we are better off asking Trace3 to show add more transparency in their quote.  I think the SKUs are correct so that?s some good news.  The attached Excel file shows the work in progress.  I haven?t suggested targets yet since there?s too many open items.  Of note:  ?\tVOR-TE ? listed for $6K about 12 months ago.  Let?s confirm this.  You may also want to take this time and ask about the bundled list price (and even net) that includes the Transparent Encryption Agent, Application Encryption and Tokenization. Another client bought the bundle (at MUCH bigger volumes ? 1,500) but paid $1K for each bundle. Webster is at $3,150 for just TE. You?re at less than 2% of their volume but I?m curious what they?d offer and it may be good to know if that?s on your roadmap.  If only two of these are of interest I don?t think they have a bundle for that but you could ask.  This other client didn?t have the Tokenization Client license so perhaps they?re configuring their solution differently than Webster. o\tThe quantity of 25 for VOR-TE and VOR-VTE-LTD brings up another topic to push for clarity on. From the limited pricing I?ve seen there?s a clear example on their Data Encryption Agent license where the first one is $6K, ten cost $45K (or $4500 each) and 25 cost $100K or $4K each).  I think now is the time to make sure they show you what all these tiers look like to ensure you?re getting both the programmatic volume discount and the additional discount you?d get on a first-time competitive buy. ?\tVOR-VTE-LTD ? the one item I had no traction finding list pricing for ?\tVOR-TOKEN ? educated guess is this is also at $6K list ?\tThe DSM Enterprise Parts I believe have the same list and they just discount non-prod more than prod.  The list could be $30K or something north of $40K.  That reflects quite a swing in discounting so it is a key item to validate.  I?d be appreciative if you could also ask them for the list price of the physical DSM Enterprise equivalent. Perhaps you could say someone asked about that option and you wanted to understand it more.  I think it lists for at least $5K more. ?\tOn the Support side, Standard is always 18% of net and Premium is 22%.  We?ve never seen Premium+ which is what?s reflected on your quote.  Below is a picture of the comparison of these two in their SW Lic Agreement.  They?re offering the + at 23% of the total hardware and software net.  Doesn?t sound like a bad uplift over Premium assuming you?re getting something more.  Consider your options there.  ?\tSome services details are shown. o\tVormetric?s rack rate is $2,500/day. VOR-PRO-SERV is the SKU.  We?ve seen it not discounted typically.   o\tProgram Review and Roadmap Dev seems like it?ll be work done by Trace3 for a fixed fee of $51,800. They mention a Security Architect and PM. No hours are mentioned.   We?d expect this to reflect some hourly estimate applied against the rates and then a 10-20% uplift for the risk involved with a fixed fee engagement.  Maybe ask about a T&M to get exposure to the rates and effort. o\tProduct Install appears to be Vormetric people.  Offered at $12,500 that?s 5 days at their $2,500 rack rate.  That number of days doesn?t seem bloated.  In a competitive environment feels like that could be something to push for free. o\tTech Design and Impl - $67,500 for 6 weeks. That?s $11,250 a week or $2,250 a day if one resource which is exactly 10% off the Vormetric daily rack rate of $2500. It includes an Architect, Engineer and PM but again is offered at a fixed amount so no effort/hours noted.  Push for some clarity around this.  Is this Trace3 or Vormetric. On the one hand you?d expect a lower rate with Trace3 but oftentimes partners bring more senior resources to bear than the OEM/Publisher. o\tRoadmap and Mentoring is offered at $51,800 and is T&M. It is largely an architect at $300.  We can benchmark this.  Is this Trace3 or Vormetric.  We?ll work on what we can but let me know if you expect to reach out to Trace3 for this additional detail.  Now is the time and no reason to spend this money if there?s any questions about the transparency of the offer.  Also, do you expect future growth.  Getting transparency now sets you up for that.",
        "customer_comments": "Went with Vormetric.  Final quote increased in size largely due to Token Server Client item growing from 1 to 18.  The only reductions appear to be on the DSM units as both the Prod and non prod had reductions.  Maintenance also dropped from 23% to 20%.

The majority of the spend falls under XIV storage, with XIV hardware (26%) and software (39%) comprising the majority of the spend (65%).  That ratio goes up further (71%) if Technical Advisors related to XIV are included (6%).  Analyzing hardware in this space requires greater granular configuration data for the equipment covered and can be an exacting process.  BJC?s configuration data may sway FMV analysis slightly, but there are sufficient commoditized hardware, software, and service items in the provided spreadsheet to complete a more exacting assessment.  Current price increases over the previous 5-Year term are within FMV guidelines that target anything lower than 5% annual, with BJC?s totals at nearly 4% when comparing previous and current 5-year totals.  While the overall spend is within FMV guidelines, XIV and Pseries hardware are ripe for third-party maintainers once assets are off initial support, and as a result IBM faces pricing pressure in the current market.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tBJC?s pricing is at FMV for bottom-line costs, even with increase over previous annual rates.  Addressing cost increases that did exceed 20% is the first recommended savings target, as FMV rate increase of 15% (3% per year of the previous term) are more in line with this sizable operating cost.   ?\tEquipment nearly end of life or items that may otherwise be covered by SMS can be targeted as areas for most aggressive savings expectations.  Got final doc.  Did a serial number search and compared final cost to the three year offer.  The spreadsheet had a bunch of scenarios.  Seemed like the right comparison.  Shown in Excel.  Changed contract to 8908 since we didn't get to show this in prior year and was so close. likely didn't get acted on til after new contract started.",

        "current_narrative": "Hi Jennifer, Thanks for sending your add-on license purchase for review.  I see Aspect is using the same negotiation tactic as they did in 2016 where they started with a 30% discount and ended with 40%.  That purchase had an extended list price of $300K for licenses while this purchase is at $235K.  The 5% uplift is possible as our last review for Aspect was right at the end of 2017 and Aspect doesn?t publish a price list.  That 2017 review had list prices that matched the ones being shown/offered to Progressive.   They hadn?t raised their prices in a couple of years and my guess is just before your last purchase in 2016 there had been a recent 10% increase.  The Aspect story has changed little: they?ve moved from leader to niche player in the latest Gartner report (Feb 2018), mainly focused on existing clients.  Progressive in effect are investing dollars into the enhancement of a SaaS solution you don't own.  My SME advises postponing the buy if possible (maybe not feasible) and survey the market for better solution and a lower TCO.  Of course, this is a mouthful and easier said than done.  However, it could generate some talking points in support of your negotiation.  Ask about the R&D into the perpetual license solution.  The talent on the R&D and Support side can?t be focused on Progressive?s solution.  Push hard for specifics.  Has the release schedule slowed down?  Less in each release?  Any more major releases expected?  While leverage may not be on your side, this allows you to push for better pricing on this as you double your footprint.  It just makes common sense.  If they indicate less R&D and fewer releases then why are they trying to raise prices.  Feels like they are milking the old product while they furiously work on their SaaS offering.   Focusing back on the commercial terms, we continue to expect to see Mission Critical Maintenance at 22% and Business Day Maintenance at 20%.  This is where Progressive landed in 2016 and that?s the current offer.  It is small dollars but you?d kind of expect the gap to be bigger i.e., Business Day to be 18% vs. MC at 22%; however, they?ve been consistent.  Along the same negotiation points noted above, if Progressive feels as though support is deteriorating and software releases are less robust and fewer and far between that is reason enough to push for a lower percentage.  Maintenance costs are comprised of phone support and software releases and patches so if any aspect is weakening then customers have the right to push for relief.  During our last review we noted that they just emerged from bankruptcy and were struggling to rollout  a cloud offering.  We suggested a 50%+ target but the leverage worked against Progressive and you topped off at 40%.  This feels like a rinse-and-repeat scenario.  40% feels a bit low in light of market conditions and the 2x growth.  NPI suggests targeting a 50% final discount which typically requires pushing for more than that to allow for the compromise.  Achieving a 50% discount drives $23,500 out of license spend and about $3,500 out of support. Driving Mission Critical support to 20% would save an additional $2500.",

Pricing Analysis  ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions. ?\tThe core SaaS bundle is priced at $2.74 per employee, per month (PEPM). The list pricing for this bundle is $7 PEPM, which is an increase from the previous list price of $5 PEPM.  o\tFor 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $1.82 PEPM. This translates to savings of $13,800 per month. ?\tThe Workforce Activities software is priced at $0.45 PEPM. This price is at Fair Market Value (FMV). ?\tThe Workforce Accruals software is priced at $0.26, which is also at FMV. ?\t The Workforce Record Manager is priced at $0.15. For 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $0.11 PEPM. This translates to savings of $600 per month. ?\tWF Analytics is priced at $0.86 PEPM. This price is FMV. ?\tThe overall savings based on NPI?s recommended target price translates to $14,400 per month and $358,560 for the 36-month period with a 24-month ramp up.  Other considerations: ?\tNPI has not seen Kronos insist on prepayment for the subscriptions. This is certainly negotiable. ?\tHowever, NPI has also not seen Kronos concede to a ramp up pricing, which reduces the revenue in years 1 and 2.  o\tMost SaaS vendors prefer an even annual or front-loaded pricing/revenue model and a 3-5 year commitment.  A ramp up licensing scenario inevitably results in higher pricing per license for the customer and higher TCO over 5 years. However, if a customer has strong leverage (for example, if the customer already has perpetual licenses and does not need the licenses since they don?t require upgrades, and therefore would not be likely to make the purchase at all, or if there is competition in the mix), the vendor will concede to these terms. ?\tA target of $2 per employee per month for Time and Accruals for 15,000 employees is achievable. The motivation by Kronos to provide a larger incentive for a large employee base is in line with their marketing approach, which highly touts the number of users/employees that use or are managed through KRONOS cloud. ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially on the add-on subscriptions.",

        "current_narrative": "Here are some thoughts on the SAS renewal:  NPI has observed that SAS is a vendor who likes to keep customers in the dark about their pricing.  They have different list pricing depending on the volume of spend and they are very inconsistent in the pricing they will agree to.  What this does tell us is that SAS pricing is highly negotiable.  We know that test environments are typically 25% of the production costs and list prices for Dev and Test are based on a percentage of the list price for the production environment.  There doesn?t seem to be quite enough information in this proposal (email) for NPI to provide a detailed benchmark.  Below are some thoughts and recommendations that VSP will want to consider.  ?\tAt first blush, the descriptions in the email you attached aren?t detailed enough for us to be able to calculate list price.  Additionally, there are no productions fees in the email description, so we are not able to determine list price and discount percentages for the Dev and Test environments.  If we have better descriptions of the licenses or - better still - if we have SKUs we can usually figure out list price and discount percentages for FYFs.  Having said that, Dev and Test environments list pricing tends to be a percentage of the production costs.  NOTE: NPI strongly recommends that you ask for list price on the FYFs so we can be sure we have the correct discount percentage.  SAS will share list price if pushed. ?\tWe like to see the first-RYF to be between 27-35% of the FYF.  VSP is at 28% for both the Dev and Test licenses, so that is good, however:   o\tWe still want to gauge the discount of the FYF fees even though we like 28% for the RYF. Often we see that a good RYF percentage is due to the first year fee is not well discounted. ?\tWe also like to see the third year fee to be 3% over the second year fee.  SAS has offered 5%.  That?s a standard starting offer.  Target 3%. ?\tHow big is VSPs overall footprint with SAS?  Can you provide financial details around your production environment?  That helps us adjust our targeted discount for this particular transaction.  It is largely handled standalone by SAS but the big picture should be considered especially if it benefits VSPs. ?\tThe professional services rates are actually very good in the SOW.  We usually don?t see large market variances in SAS professional services rates. o\tThe technical consultant is billed at $195. We see market rates between $195 - $200 per hour. o\tTechnical architects typically bill at $225 per hour. o\tThe Project Manager is billed at $180. We typically see this at $200 per hour.  If you can provide a bit more detail, I am confident that we can offer more detailed analysis of your SAS pricing.",

        "current_narrative": "Hey Robert, Prior to you sending the revised Safenet offer we had taken some time to try and find all the list prices as they weren?t provided in the quote.  That history can be helpful as you continue negotiations. The prior two offers were at poor discounts of 0-2%.  We couldn?t validate a couple of items.  They have a crazy number of SKUs complicated by a series of acquisitions (Aladdin, Safenet, Gemalto, and Thales (who also own competitor Vormetric)).  I?m attaching our efforts which can be found in the first worksheet.  The feedback was going to be this looks to be budgetary (we hope) and Webster should insist that list prices be provided and also ask for list prices for tiers below and above the quantities you are buying for the Tokenization Manager licenses.  The ?2? at the end of the SKU refers to the second volume tier 11-20.    The recent quote had different SKUs.  Again, I think we figured out the list prices but it requires some art and science.  The two prior quotes totaled about $300K.  The latest is around $700K.  The discount appears to have increased to just under 12%.  See the second worksheet in the Excel file.  I believe all the three-year maintenance items list for 24% of the hw/sw list cost each year and are discounted the same 12% (so they remain at 24% of the NET cost).  Plus Maintenance is priced at 24% and Extended Maintenance (not what Webster is buying) is priced at 18%.  I suggest Webster ask for list prices to validate NPIs figures.  If NPIs list prices are incorrect we?ll want to revisit this review.  At this spend level and in a competitive environment, 30% would be the minimum discount NPI suggests Webster should target and 40%-50% is not an unrealistic goal.  NPI hasn?t seen a ton of SafeNet deals but have seen several smaller ones that landed in the mid to high 20s making 30% our floor.  We have fewer data points on the top end.  We?ve seen a million plus purchase comprised largely of subscriptions at over 60%.  This purchase has a different dollar profile and product mix but it helped to form our ceiling.  NPI can?t provide a narrower target than 35-50% as our estimate of FMV.  With confidence we believe anything under 30% is NOT FMV.  Anything into the 50s at this dollar size feels stellar and a great outcome.  That leaves the wide swath of 30-50%.  Based on our data and this sizable purchase I bumped up the bottom of the range to 35%.  The goal would be to keep Maintenance at the same 24% of the net spend with a best case outcome of 22%.  NPI has seen SafeNet discount hw/sw considerably more than Maintenance.  I?ve included the math supporting our low and high targets in the second worksheet.  If we get any more late-breaking data points I?ll share that info.",

The majority of the spend falls under XIV storage, with XIV hardware (26%) and software (39%) comprising the majority of the spend (65%).  That ratio goes up further (71%) if Technical Advisors related to XIV are included (6%).  Analyzing hardware in this space requires greater granular configuration data for the equipment covered and can be an exacting process.  BJC?s configuration data may sway FMV analysis slightly, but there are sufficient commoditized hardware, software, and service items in the provided spreadsheet to complete a more exacting assessment.  Current price increases over the previous 5-Year term are within FMV guidelines that target anything lower than 5% annual, with BJC?s totals at nearly 4% when comparing previous and current 5-year totals.  While the overall spend is within FMV guidelines, XIV and Pseries hardware are ripe for third-party maintainers once assets are off initial support, and as a result IBM faces pricing pressure in the current market.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Kronos and found the pricing for the core SaaS bundle to be above Fair Market Value (FMV) with room for improvement of up to 24% based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the other add-on software subscriptions are at FMV.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions. ?\tThe core SaaS bundle is priced at $2.74 per employee, per month (PEPM). The list pricing for this bundle is $7 PEPM, which is an increase from the previous list price of $5 PEPM.  o\tFor 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $1.82 PEPM. This translates to savings of $13,800 per month. ?\tThe Workforce Activities software is priced at $0.45 PEPM. This price is at Fair Market Value (FMV). ?\tThe Workforce Accruals software is priced at $0.26, which is also at FMV. ?\t The Workforce Record Manager is priced at $0.15. For 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $0.11 PEPM. This translates to savings of $600 per month. ?\tWF Analytics is priced at $0.86 PEPM. This price is FMV. ?\tThe overall savings based on NPI?s recommended target price translates to $14,400 per month and $358,560 for the 36-month period with a 24-month ramp up.  Other considerations: ?\tNPI has not seen Kronos insist on prepayment for the subscriptions. This is certainly negotiable. ?\tHowever, NPI has also not seen Kronos concede to a ramp up pricing, which reduces the revenue in years 1 and 2.  o\tMost SaaS vendors prefer an even annual or front-loaded pricing/revenue model and a 3-5 year commitment.  A ramp up licensing scenario inevitably results in higher pricing per license for the customer and higher TCO over 5 years. However, if a customer has strong leverage (for example, if the customer already has perpetual licenses and does not need the licenses since they don?t require upgrades, and therefore would not be likely to make the purchase at all, or if there is competition in the mix), the vendor will concede to these terms. ?\tA target of $2 per employee per month for Time and Accruals for 15,000 employees is achievable. The motivation by Kronos to provide a larger incentive for a large employee base is in line with their marketing approach, which highly touts the number of users/employees that use or are managed through KRONOS cloud. ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially on the add-on subscriptions.",

        "current_narrative": "Here are some thoughts on the SAS renewal:  NPI has observed that SAS is a vendor who likes to keep customers in the dark about their pricing.  They have different list pricing depending on the volume of spend and they are very inconsistent in the pricing they will agree to.  What this does tell us is that SAS pricing is highly negotiable.  We know that test environments are typically 25% of the production costs and list prices for Dev and Test are based on a percentage of the list price for the production environment.  There doesn?t seem to be quite enough information in this proposal (email) for NPI to provide a detailed benchmark.  Below are some thoughts and recommendations that VSP will want to consider.  ?\tAt first blush, the descriptions in the email you attached aren?t detailed enough for us to be able to calculate list price.  Additionally, there are no productions fees in the email description, so we are not able to determine list price and discount percentages for the Dev and Test environments.  If we have better descriptions of the licenses or - better still - if we have SKUs we can usually figure out list price and discount percentages for FYFs.  Having said that, Dev and Test environments list pricing tends to be a percentage of the production costs.  NOTE: NPI strongly recommends that you ask for list price on the FYFs so we can be sure we have the correct discount percentage.  SAS will share list price if pushed. ?\tWe like to see the first-RYF to be between 27-35% of the FYF.  VSP is at 28% for both the Dev and Test licenses, so that is good, however:   o\tWe still want to gauge the discount of the FYF fees even though we like 28% for the RYF. Often we see that a good RYF percentage is due to the first year fee is not well discounted. ?\tWe also like to see the third year fee to be 3% over the second year fee.  SAS has offered 5%.  That?s a standard starting offer.  Target 3%. ?\tHow big is VSPs overall footprint with SAS?  Can you provide financial details around your production environment?  That helps us adjust our targeted discount for this particular transaction.  It is largely handled standalone by SAS but the big picture should be considered especially if it benefits VSPs. ?\tThe professional services rates are actually very good in the SOW.  We usually don?t see large market variances in SAS professional services rates. o\tThe technical consultant is billed at $195. We see market rates between $195 - $200 per hour. o\tTechnical architects typically bill at $225 per hour. o\tThe Project Manager is billed at $180. We typically see this at $200 per hour.  If you can provide a bit more detail, I am confident that we can offer more detailed analysis of your SAS pricing.",

        "current_narrative": "In summary, the proposed pricing from Adobe is at the low end of the range of Fair Market Value as compared to similar market transactions.  NPI reviewed the original Adobe Analytics purchase for Intuit (In June 2016).  Adobe had proposed pricing of $28 for 90 Billion server calls and $25 for 100 Billion server calls per year. NPI had recommended targets of $25 for 90 billion server calls and $23 for 100 billion server calls which targets Intuit achieved at the time resulting in savings of $233K for 1 year.  In a subsequent renewal early last year, the pricing has remained flat at $23 for 100 Billion server calls.  Adobe Analytics Changes   Adobe previously offered Analytics in two editions, standard and premium.  ?\tAdobe has repackaged the Analytics Cloud (announced March 2017) and now offers three editions: Select, Prime and Ultimate. The license metric continues to be Million SERVER CALLS Per Month. Each product increases in functionality and price from Select to Prime to Ultimate. ?\tPreviously, secondary calls cost 50% of Primary server calls, but that is no longer the case. Now, both primary and secondary calls have the same cost and count towards the total calls. ?\tAdobe increased the price for all of their analytics solutions this year when they introduced the three new analytics products. ?\tBased on Intuit's usage of Adobe Analytics and price point, Intuit has been offered the Prime product for this renewal.  Price Breakdown     ?\tIt is common for Adobe to offer pricing tiers like the offered table for companies to project their spend as they grow.  Typically Adobe will offer 3 options - they have offered seven options in this proposal, which is generous.   ?\tIntuit is being offered great pricing on Adobe Analytics Prime. This pricing is likely to have had not only management exception approval but also executive approval. Intuit?s Adobe rep likely had to fight a battle internally to get this pricing approved.    Recommendation ?\tOverall, NPI believes that Intuit has received great pricing from Adobe for the Analytics Prime and the pricing has remained flat since 2016/2017.  ?\tThe Sitecat Data Feed is priced at $1,350 CPMM. NPI recommends a pricing of $1250 CPMM which translates to savings of $14,400 per year. ?\tAt this level of spend, Intuit can request free training and free passes to Adobe Summit.  FINAL UPDATE: Great news, we were able to negotiate our pricing further to 21.25 for 120B primary server calls (price intended for 150B) and continue to pay 11.50 for secondary postponing the increase in price for secondary. Thank you!",

        "current_narrative": "Hey Robert, Prior to you sending the revised Safenet offer we had taken some time to try and find all the list prices as they weren?t provided in the quote.  That history can be helpful as you continue negotiations. The prior two offers were at poor discounts of 0-2%.  We couldn?t validate a couple of items.  They have a crazy number of SKUs complicated by a series of acquisitions (Aladdin, Safenet, Gemalto, and Thales (who also own competitor Vormetric)).  I?m attaching our efforts which can be found in the first worksheet.  The feedback was going to be this looks to be budgetary (we hope) and Webster should insist that list prices be provided and also ask for list prices for tiers below and above the quantities you are buying for the Tokenization Manager licenses.  The ?2? at the end of the SKU refers to the second volume tier 11-20.    The recent quote had different SKUs.  Again, I think we figured out the list prices but it requires some art and science.  The two prior quotes totaled about $300K.  The latest is around $700K.  The discount appears to have increased to just under 12%.  See the second worksheet in the Excel file.  I believe all the three-year maintenance items list for 24% of the hw/sw list cost each year and are discounted the same 12% (so they remain at 24% of the NET cost).  Plus Maintenance is priced at 24% and Extended Maintenance (not what Webster is buying) is priced at 18%.  I suggest Webster ask for list prices to validate NPIs figures.  If NPIs list prices are incorrect we?ll want to revisit this review.  At this spend level and in a competitive environment, 30% would be the minimum discount NPI suggests Webster should target and 40%-50% is not an unrealistic goal.  NPI hasn?t seen a ton of SafeNet deals but have seen several smaller ones that landed in the mid to high 20s making 30% our floor.  We have fewer data points on the top end.  We?ve seen a million plus purchase comprised largely of subscriptions at over 60%.  This purchase has a different dollar profile and product mix but it helped to form our ceiling.  NPI can?t provide a narrower target than 35-50% as our estimate of FMV.  With confidence we believe anything under 30% is NOT FMV.  Anything into the 50s at this dollar size feels stellar and a great outcome.  That leaves the wide swath of 30-50%.  Based on our data and this sizable purchase I bumped up the bottom of the range to 35%.  The goal would be to keep Maintenance at the same 24% of the net spend with a best case outcome of 22%.  NPI has seen SafeNet discount hw/sw considerably more than Maintenance.  I?ve included the math supporting our low and high targets in the second worksheet.  If we get any more late-breaking data points I?ll share that info.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Kronos and found the pricing for the core SaaS bundle to be above Fair Market Value (FMV) with room for improvement of up to 24% based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the other add-on software subscriptions are at FMV.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions. ?\tThe core SaaS bundle is priced at $2.74 per employee, per month (PEPM). The list pricing for this bundle is $7 PEPM, which is an increase from the previous list price of $5 PEPM.  o\tFor 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $1.82 PEPM. This translates to savings of $13,800 per month. ?\tThe Workforce Activities software is priced at $0.45 PEPM. This price is at Fair Market Value (FMV). ?\tThe Workforce Accruals software is priced at $0.26, which is also at FMV. ?\t The Workforce Record Manager is priced at $0.15. For 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $0.11 PEPM. This translates to savings of $600 per month. ?\tWF Analytics is priced at $0.86 PEPM. This price is FMV. ?\tThe overall savings based on NPI?s recommended target price translates to $14,400 per month and $358,560 for the 36-month period with a 24-month ramp up.  Other considerations: ?\tNPI has not seen Kronos insist on prepayment for the subscriptions. This is certainly negotiable. ?\tHowever, NPI has also not seen Kronos concede to a ramp up pricing, which reduces the revenue in years 1 and 2.  o\tMost SaaS vendors prefer an even annual or front-loaded pricing/revenue model and a 3-5 year commitment.  A ramp up licensing scenario inevitably results in higher pricing per license for the customer and higher TCO over 5 years. However, if a customer has strong leverage (for example, if the customer already has perpetual licenses and does not need the licenses since they don?t require upgrades, and therefore would not be likely to make the purchase at all, or if there is competition in the mix), the vendor will concede to these terms. ?\tA target of $2 per employee per month for Time and Accruals for 15,000 employees is achievable. The motivation by Kronos to provide a larger incentive for a large employee base is in line with their marketing approach, which highly touts the number of users/employees that use or are managed through KRONOS cloud. ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially on the add-on subscriptions.",

They have a crazy number of SKUs complicated by a series of acquisitions (Aladdin, Safenet, Gemalto, and Thales (who also own competitor Vormetric)).  I?m attaching our efforts which can be found in the first worksheet.  The feedback was going to be this looks to be budgetary (we hope) and Webster should insist that list prices be provided and also ask for list prices for tiers below and above the quantities you are buying for the Tokenization Manager licenses.  The ?2? at the end of the SKU refers to the second volume tier 11-20.    The recent quote had different SKUs.  Again, I think we figured out the list prices but it requires some art and science.  The two prior quotes totaled about $300K.  The latest is around $700K.  The discount appears to have increased to just under 12%.  See the second worksheet in the Excel file.  I believe all the three-year maintenance items list for 24% of the hw/sw list cost each year and are discounted the same 12% (so they remain at 24% of the NET cost).  Plus Maintenance is priced at 24% and Extended Maintenance (not what Webster is buying) is priced at 18%.  I suggest Webster ask for list prices to validate NPIs figures.  If NPIs list prices are incorrect we?ll want to revisit this review.  At this spend level and in a competitive environment, 30% would be the minimum discount NPI suggests Webster should target and 40%-50% is not an unrealistic goal.  NPI hasn?t seen a ton of SafeNet deals but have seen several smaller ones that landed in the mid to high 20s making 30% our floor.  We have fewer data points on the top end.  We?ve seen a million plus purchase comprised largely of subscriptions at over 60%.  This purchase has a different dollar profile and product mix but it helped to form our ceiling.  NPI can?t provide a narrower target than 35-50% as our estimate of FMV.  With confidence we believe anything under 30% is NOT FMV.  Anything into the 50s at this dollar size feels stellar and a great outcome.  That leaves the wide swath of 30-50%.  Based on our data and this sizable purchase I bumped up the bottom of the range to 35%.  The goal would be to keep Maintenance at the same 24% of the net spend with a best case outcome of 22%.  NPI has seen SafeNet discount hw/sw considerably more than Maintenance.  I?ve included the math supporting our low and high targets in the second worksheet.  If we get any more late-breaking data points I?ll share that info.",

        "description": "Gregg,  Webster Bank is currently looking at a solution that can provide a solution that can provide enterprise key management across Webster?s applications on premise and in the cloud.  Currently key management at Webster Bank is not a cohesive process but maintained by the individual systems that use keys.     High Level Requirements:   ?\tGenerating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications.  ?\tGenerating and obtaining public keys.  ?\tDistributing keys to intended users, including how keys should be activated when received.  ?\tStoring keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys.  ?\tChanging or updating keys, including rules on when and how keys should be changed.  ?\tAddressing compromised keys.  ?\tArchiving, revoking, and specifying how keys should be withdrawn or deactivated.  ?\tRecovering keys that are lost or corrupted as part of business continuity management.  ?\tReporting and logging the auditing of key management-related activities.  ?\tInstituting defined activation and deactivation dates, and limiting the usage period of keys. ?\tIntegrates with Netapp, Sales Force and has a rest API to program with Webster custom applications.  I have attached the two proposals we received.  Would you please review and come back to us with feedback?  If you can turn this around quickly, it would be appreciated.",

This did not lend itself to a full FMV document, but if you need a more formal document, I can put something together for you.  ?\tOverall, the discounting on years 1 & 2, at ~39% is some of the best discounting we?ve seen.  This is a Corporate VP level discount within Microsoft. o\tWe have other, larger Microsoft clients that are not able to get to that discount level. o\tWe suspect that a combination of a) your relatively low dollar commit, b) only purchasing Core CAL?s, and c) Chico?s next big purchase will be in 2-years with the EA renewal, makes Chico?s a ?target for opportunity? within Microsoft.  Microsoft will be looking to significantly increase the revenue they get from Chico?s, either by adding on new products, or significantly reducing your discount levels at the time of the EA renewal. ?\tIt is common that Microsoft is trying to ramp down the 3rd year discount to 20%.  NPI recommends that you push hard for consistency across all 3-years. ?\tYou will want to be sure to have a ?Not to Exceed? (NTE) clause added to this contract so that the renewal cost does not exceed either CPI or CAGR.  We recommend that you target a NTE 3% increase (over 3-years), but Microsoft will most likely settle on 6% - 10%. ?\tChico?s is receiving solid additional funding in Deployment Funds, CSM, and Fast Track, etc.  There may be even more funding available, but Chico?s would have to tie it to some specific project.  So, overall, Year 1 & 2 pricing are very good.  We recommend that you push for 3rd year consistency and add the NTE.  At that point, Chico?s could move forward with confidence on this purchase.",

Pricing Analysis ?\tAdobe has two main volume programs, the ETLA and the VIP program. NPI more frequently sees the ETLA program than the VIP.  ?\tIn terms of editions, the Teams licenses are directed towards small and medium businesses and the Enterprise version, which is priced higher, is targeted towards large customers. ?\tMichael Kors? current pricing appears to be grandfathered in from prior purchases; the proposed pricing represents a 0% increase in price from the previous year?s pricing.  ?\tIn terms of discount, the offered discount is 15%, which is at FMV.  o\tNPI typically sees discounts ranging between 0% and 15%, with median discounts between 8% and 10%. ?\tIn summary, Michael Kors can confidently move forward with this purchase as is.",

        "current_narrative": "Hey Robert, Prior to you sending the revised Safenet offer we had taken some time to try and find all the list prices as they weren?t provided in the quote.  That history can be helpful as you continue negotiations. The prior two offers were at poor discounts of 0-2%.  We couldn?t validate a couple of items.  They have a crazy number of SKUs complicated by a series of acquisitions (Aladdin, Safenet, Gemalto, and Thales (who also own competitor Vormetric)).  I?m attaching our efforts which can be found in the first worksheet.  The feedback was going to be this looks to be budgetary (we hope) and Webster should insist that list prices be provided and also ask for list prices for tiers below and above the quantities you are buying for the Tokenization Manager licenses.  The ?2? at the end of the SKU refers to the second volume tier 11-20.    The recent quote had different SKUs.  Again, I think we figured out the list prices but it requires some art and science.  The two prior quotes totaled about $300K.  The latest is around $700K.  The discount appears to have increased to just under 12%.  See the second worksheet in the Excel file.  I believe all the three-year maintenance items list for 24% of the hw/sw list cost each year and are discounted the same 12% (so they remain at 24% of the NET cost).  Plus Maintenance is priced at 24% and Extended Maintenance (not what Webster is buying) is priced at 18%.  I suggest Webster ask for list prices to validate NPIs figures.  If NPIs list prices are incorrect we?ll want to revisit this review.  At this spend level and in a competitive environment, 30% would be the minimum discount NPI suggests Webster should target and 40%-50% is not an unrealistic goal.  NPI hasn?t seen a ton of SafeNet deals but have seen several smaller ones that landed in the mid to high 20s making 30% our floor.  We have fewer data points on the top end.  We?ve seen a million plus purchase comprised largely of subscriptions at over 60%.  This purchase has a different dollar profile and product mix but it helped to form our ceiling.  NPI can?t provide a narrower target than 35-50% as our estimate of FMV.  With confidence we believe anything under 30% is NOT FMV.  Anything into the 50s at this dollar size feels stellar and a great outcome.  That leaves the wide swath of 30-50%.  Based on our data and this sizable purchase I bumped up the bottom of the range to 35%.  The goal would be to keep Maintenance at the same 24% of the net spend with a best case outcome of 22%.  NPI has seen SafeNet discount hw/sw considerably more than Maintenance.  I?ve included the math supporting our low and high targets in the second worksheet.  If we get any more late-breaking data points I?ll share that info.",

Upon review, we determined your current pricing to be FMV as you should feel confident in moving forward.   ?\tAs it stands, your quantity of 8,450 puts you in 8th pricing group (5,001 ? 10,000).  o\tPricing does get better as you move up groups but there is an obvious increased multiplier making the overall cost higher. o\tSince your initial TAPADS purchase in 2016, your YoY increase has consistently remained at ~1%.  Year\tTotal\tIncrease 2016\t$105,158\tN/A 2017\t$106,629\t1.4% 2018\t$107,830\t1.1%  ?\tPlatinum Support is at ~10% of license spend and is considered FMV. o\tProofpoint will include Platinum Support at no charge when bought as SaaS, but not otherwise. This is the case with the current quote and past reviews performed by NPI. This is something to consider as it could result in significant savings across your current landscape.  Description\tPart #\tQTY\tUnit Price\tExt Price Proofpoint Targeted Attack Protection Attachment Defense Virtual Edition\tPP-M-TAPADS-V-D-108\t8450\t$11.60\t$98,020 Proofpoint Platinum Support - technical support - 1 year\tPP-SUP-PS-12\t1\t$9,810\t$9,810 \t\t\t\t$107,830  It is worth considering a consolidation of current contracts under one to allow for more consistent discounting, transparency, and prevent negotiating as frequently. If CAMC really wants to gain the attention of Proofpoint, you should consider a multi-year agreement. In NPI?s experience, CAMC could reduce the year over year costs by as much as 35% with a multi-year commitment with the right messaging and timing.",

        "current_narrative": "Smita has some data that shows the daily rate is slightly less than what we have seen from Verint before.  However, the overall blended rate for this project is $244 / hour.  This is largely because the lowest cost resource is at $225/hour.  From their input, it appear they have a lot of business with Verint and use them either extensively or exclusively for professional services.  Asking for a 10% loyalty discount across the board is not unwarranted.  Other observation.  The resources on this project are a bit skewed.  The PM represents 25.8% of the time, the Solution Delivery Architect represents 22.6%.  This seems very high for both.  We would expect a project like this might only have 10 ? 15% participation by these two resources and the balance divided between the application consultant and systems engineer.  Re-juggling the balance of resources doesn?t really impact the overall cost though since the sdev of rates is only $24/hour.   To Client: Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  We have seen a number of Verint proposals, many that include professional services so I was able to do some comparative analysis.  The information below did not lend itself to a full FMV report, but if you need this info in a more formal document, I can put that together for you, just let me know.  The feedback on this consultant pricing is mixed: ?\tFrom a high-level perspective looking at the daily rates, this is in line with what we have seen from Verint.  So at a high-level, this pricing is within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV).  However, ?. ?\tBased on your description of the amount of work that VSP has done with Verint, NPI is also looking at the breakdown of hourly rates for this SOW: o\tThe overall blended hourly rate for this project is $240/hr, which NPI considers to be a little higher than FMV.  A portion of the ?higher than FMV? determination may have something to do with the number of hours for some of the resources ? more on that below. o\tThe App Consultant and System Engineer are both at $225/hr.  With the amount of spend that VSP has with Verint, NPI believes these rates are a bit high.  We recommend targeting an hourly rate closer to $200/hr, $1600/day. o\tThe hourly rate for the Project Manager is $237.50, which NPI considers to be a bit higher than FMV.  The hourly rate for the PM should be reduced a bit to $220 - $225 per hour or $1800/day. o\tThe Solution Architect is priced at $275/hr which NPI also considers to be above FMV for a company with VSP?s Verint spend.  A rate closer to $240 - $250 ($2K/day) would be more in line with market rate. o\tUsing the target hourly rates above, with the same number of days for each resource, the total price tag would be closer to $54K for this SOW. ?\tAnother observation that NPI found is that the resources on this project seem to be a bit skewed, based on the resource make-up that we have seen on similar projects for other clients.   o\tThe PM represents 25.4% of the time, the Solution Delivery Architect represents 23.8%.  This seems very high for both.  We would expect a project like this might only have 10 ? 15% participation by these two resources and the balance divided between the application consultant and systems engineer.  NPI recommends that VSP inquire with Verint on this and verify the need for this level of effort for these resources (at these prices).  If it makes sense to reduce the hours for these 2 resources, it could affect overall pricing since these are the most expensive resources.",

        "current_narrative": "We reviewed Mavenlink and Workfront together... VSP went with Workfront - achieves small savings there.    NPI provided feedback via email, see attached.  Not a lot of previous exposure to Mavenlink as it appears more costly than Workfront. Suggested targeting lower cost license (premier) to see $20K reduction in quoted license (enterprise) pricing or even choosing the lower cost item.  NPI recommends that VSP approach Mavenlink with dollar figures instead of discount percentages.  The message to Mavenlink could be something along these lines, ?We had an expectation ? and set our budget accordingly ? that we would see a charge more like $30/user/month, or $360/year.  The current offer of $60/user/month is really a non-starter.  This is a competitive bid situation and for the most part, the remaining solutions are technically similar.  So it has come down to a pricing conversation, and Mavenlink is losing ? badly.  We may be able to rob Peter to pay Paul and move some additional money into the budget for this project, but we won?t be able to get near $72K.?  Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like to discuss further on a call.",
        "customer_comments": "After our conversation yesterday re: Workfront & Mavenlink, I wanted to follow-up with the feedback on Mavenlink (Workfront feedback sent in different email).  We?ve discussed everything below, but wanted to get it to you in written form so you have it.  Originally, NPI reviewed a 36-month term for Mavenlink Enterprise for 200 users.  In our discussion yesterday, we see that Mavenlink is now offering a 24% discount for 100 users, for a total license cost of $72K.  While NPI has seen fewer Mavenlink deals than we have seen for Workfront, we have enough data points to provide some general market analysis.  NPI believes the target discount for this size deal is closer to 30% - 35% discounting which would result in a total annual license cost of ~$60K.  Regarding the professional services, these are offered with 0% discounting.  It is not unusual that professional services have no discount, but on a deal of this size and term length, it is also reasonable to seek a nominal 5% - 15% discount on these services.  See the table below for an illustration of NPI?s recommended targets:",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the Oracle Fusion Financials Cloud subscription pricing and found the pricing to be within the range of Fair Market Value with room for improvement.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tOracle has offered a blended discount of 54.4% for various Oracle Financial Cloud Services.  o\tIn the past year, NPI has seen a large discount variance for Oracle Cloud products in general and particularly for the EPM and Financial stacks. o\t NPI has seen discounts vary between 20% and 86%.  o\tThe typical expected discount range for transactions of this size is 45% - 64.8%.   ?\tWhile the offered discount of 54.4% is within this market range, there is room for improvement in discounting of up to 10%.  Oracle Cloud discounts and pricing are based on factors such as:  ?\tQuantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customer prior to purchasing the cloud subscription (Oracle provides big incentives when customers are moving from perpetual to cloud licenses, including shelving credits, credits for prepaid maintenance and larger discounts on the cloud products) ?\tCustomer requirements and negotiation leverage ?\tPresence of competitors ?\tSenior Management/CXO level connects/escalations  ?\tVolume and total spend with Oracle  Oracle?s Cloud Strategy  Oracle is in a full-court press to move as many customers to the Cloud as possible, even though over 70% of their revenue is still from their on-premise install base.  They are \"all-in\" on the Cloud and are paying their field reps (ASMs) on cloud-only revenue.  Last year, they gave their field ASMs a small SPIFF for on-premise software sales and have moved all of their on-premise sales efforts over to their inside sales group, OracleDirect.   Oracle Pricing/discounting Strategy on Cloud Products  As mentioned earlier, NPI has observed large variances in discounting for Oracle cloud products, but overall, Oracle has been much more conservative from a discount perspective on their SaaS offerings. Typically, any discount for a SaaS tool that is over 65% must be personally reviewed by the SVP of Sales for North America         through a deal review call; historically, very few transactions over 65% have been approved.  There are exceptions to this, of course, but exceptions must be a monster deal and very strategic, an ELA or otherwise.  This is one of the reasons H&R Block has previously received discount quotes for 64%.  It's unlikely that Oracle will go any higher than a 64.9% discount, even if you threaten to walk from the deal (although that may get them to consider).",

Email back: Hi Deidre,- I had a few folks scan and chime in.  Our collective observations: ?\tThe Product Number for QC5-00002 has not changed since last year but the description has.  The price continues to be $1.50 so no change since last year or from this Feb to March.   The new name is AzureInfoProtPremP1 ShrdSvr ALNG SubsVL MVL PerUsr.  It appears they don?t sell Rights Management as an individual SKU any longer. ?\tLevel D List is $1.50 under EA and $1.70 under Select.  It can also be bought under their CSP (Cloud Solutions Program) but NPI doesn?t have that Level d list price. ?\tThe 3R2-00002 product hasn?t changed and is still $4.49.  Perhaps they quoted that if it is on your current EA and the QC5 was overlooked due to the name change. ?\tI?m attaching the file you sent with Level D list prices confirmed.  ?\tPlease note the Windows Skus are PER YEAR vs. the others on here that are per month.  I provided both the platform and non-platform option but the price they listed of 37.92 is the platform price. ?\tYou will run up against some challenges since each country is buying in their own currency o\tEach country has a different price list and you can?t take the US price list and use the latest exchange rate to come up with the right list price for a given country. This is because pricing is set at some point in the past based on an historical exchange rate.  Some will work in Metlife?s favor and some will not. o\tThey will each have their respective Level D pricing so there?s a common goal.  As you suggest 1,500 is too small of a commitment to expect a discount. NPIs FMV expectation is 0% off. If Metlife commits to some rollout up to around 5,000 agents we could see up to a 10% discount being possible.  Also, 20,000 agents + would have a 20-30% discount target.  o\tWe don?t think the Japan O365 rollout will help the non-captive agents piece.  I?m assuming you were talking about that vs. Japan buying non-captive agent licenses.  We believe MS will point to rev rec limitations and balk at reducing any set pricing that?s been negotiated for Japan.   o\tIn some countries Microsoft abstracts themselves from the customer. A partner negotiates with a customer and then negotiated with Microsoft. There?s a disconnect and MS expects to get a certain amount and partners are given some pricing latitude.  Japan, Brazil and Mexico are indirect countries. In these countries you have moving parts of the exchange rate and the indirectness. o\tFor direct countries, the goal is Level D in their currency.  ?\tAlso, one of our MS folks shared this: the participation agreement permits the entity that signed the agreement to include non-affiliated entities in their enterprise device/user counts.  A participation agreement is typically used when the parent entity (the ?enrolled affiliate?) has the ability to direct standards for the participants/franchisees/etc.  The enrolled affiliate is responsible both for placing orders for the participant (commonly outsourced to the reseller), and they are responsible for paying the bill.  Microsoft does not invoice the individual participants.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the pricing from Kronos and found the pricing for the core SaaS bundle to be above Fair Market Value (FMV) with room for improvement of up to 24% based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the other add-on software subscriptions are at FMV.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions. ?\tThe core SaaS bundle is priced at $2.74 per employee, per month (PEPM). The list pricing for this bundle is $7 PEPM, which is an increase from the previous list price of $5 PEPM.  o\tFor 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $1.82 PEPM. This translates to savings of $13,800 per month. ?\tThe Workforce Activities software is priced at $0.45 PEPM. This price is at Fair Market Value (FMV). ?\tThe Workforce Accruals software is priced at $0.26, which is also at FMV. ?\t The Workforce Record Manager is priced at $0.15. For 15,000 employees, NPI recommends a target price of $0.11 PEPM. This translates to savings of $600 per month. ?\tWF Analytics is priced at $0.86 PEPM. This price is FMV. ?\tThe overall savings based on NPI?s recommended target price translates to $14,400 per month and $358,560 for the 36-month period with a 24-month ramp up.  Other considerations: ?\tNPI has not seen Kronos insist on prepayment for the subscriptions. This is certainly negotiable. ?\tHowever, NPI has also not seen Kronos concede to a ramp up pricing, which reduces the revenue in years 1 and 2.  o\tMost SaaS vendors prefer an even annual or front-loaded pricing/revenue model and a 3-5 year commitment.  A ramp up licensing scenario inevitably results in higher pricing per license for the customer and higher TCO over 5 years. However, if a customer has strong leverage (for example, if the customer already has perpetual licenses and does not need the licenses since they don?t require upgrades, and therefore would not be likely to make the purchase at all, or if there is competition in the mix), the vendor will concede to these terms. ?\tA target of $2 per employee per month for Time and Accruals for 15,000 employees is achievable. The motivation by Kronos to provide a larger incentive for a large employee base is in line with their marketing approach, which highly touts the number of users/employees that use or are managed through KRONOS cloud. ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially on the add-on subscriptions.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the Oracle Fusion Financials Cloud subscription pricing and found the pricing to be within the range of Fair Market Value with room for improvement.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tOracle has offered a blended discount of 54.4% for various Oracle Financial Cloud Services.  o\tIn the past year, NPI has seen a large discount variance for Oracle Cloud products in general and particularly for the EPM and Financial stacks. o\t NPI has seen discounts vary between 20% and 86%.  o\tThe typical expected discount range for transactions of this size is 45% - 64.8%.   ?\tWhile the offered discount of 54.4% is within this market range, there is room for improvement in discounting of up to 10%.  Oracle Cloud discounts and pricing are based on factors such as:  ?\tQuantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customer prior to purchasing the cloud subscription (Oracle provides big incentives when customers are moving from perpetual to cloud licenses, including shelving credits, credits for prepaid maintenance and larger discounts on the cloud products) ?\tCustomer requirements and negotiation leverage ?\tPresence of competitors ?\tSenior Management/CXO level connects/escalations  ?\tVolume and total spend with Oracle  Oracle?s Cloud Strategy  Oracle is in a full-court press to move as many customers to the Cloud as possible, even though over 70% of their revenue is still from their on-premise install base.  They are \"all-in\" on the Cloud and are paying their field reps (ASMs) on cloud-only revenue.  Last year, they gave their field ASMs a small SPIFF for on-premise software sales and have moved all of their on-premise sales efforts over to their inside sales group, OracleDirect.   Oracle Pricing/discounting Strategy on Cloud Products  As mentioned earlier, NPI has observed large variances in discounting for Oracle cloud products, but overall, Oracle has been much more conservative from a discount perspective on their SaaS offerings. Typically, any discount for a SaaS tool that is over 65% must be personally reviewed by the SVP of Sales for North America         through a deal review call; historically, very few transactions over 65% have been approved.  There are exceptions to this, of course, but exceptions must be a monster deal and very strategic, an ELA or otherwise.  This is one of the reasons H&R Block has previously received discount quotes for 64%.  It's unlikely that Oracle will go any higher than a 64.9% discount, even if you threaten to walk from the deal (although that may get them to consider).",

        "current_narrative": "Cindy and Dan chimed in a bit.  Cindy on pricing and Dan on the agreement.  Largely got feedback from Dean who worked their original EA.  Email back: Hi Deidre,- I had a few folks scan and chime in.  Our collective observations: ?\tThe Product Number for QC5-00002 has not changed since last year but the description has.  The price continues to be $1.50 so no change since last year or from this Feb to March.   The new name is AzureInfoProtPremP1 ShrdSvr ALNG SubsVL MVL PerUsr.  It appears they don?t sell Rights Management as an individual SKU any longer. ?\tLevel D List is $1.50 under EA and $1.70 under Select.  It can also be bought under their CSP (Cloud Solutions Program) but NPI doesn?t have that Level d list price. ?\tThe 3R2-00002 product hasn?t changed and is still $4.49.  Perhaps they quoted that if it is on your current EA and the QC5 was overlooked due to the name change. ?\tI?m attaching the file you sent with Level D list prices confirmed.  ?\tPlease note the Windows Skus are PER YEAR vs. the others on here that are per month.  I provided both the platform and non-platform option but the price they listed of 37.92 is the platform price. ?\tYou will run up against some challenges since each country is buying in their own currency o\tEach country has a different price list and you can?t take the US price list and use the latest exchange rate to come up with the right list price for a given country. This is because pricing is set at some point in the past based on an historical exchange rate.  Some will work in Metlife?s favor and some will not. o\tThey will each have their respective Level D pricing so there?s a common goal.  As you suggest 1,500 is too small of a commitment to expect a discount. NPIs FMV expectation is 0% off. If Metlife commits to some rollout up to around 5,000 agents we could see up to a 10% discount being possible.  Also, 20,000 agents + would have a 20-30% discount target.  o\tWe don?t think the Japan O365 rollout will help the non-captive agents piece.  I?m assuming you were talking about that vs. Japan buying non-captive agent licenses.  We believe MS will point to rev rec limitations and balk at reducing any set pricing that?s been negotiated for Japan.   o\tIn some countries Microsoft abstracts themselves from the customer. A partner negotiates with a customer and then negotiated with Microsoft. There?s a disconnect and MS expects to get a certain amount and partners are given some pricing latitude.  Japan, Brazil and Mexico are indirect countries. In these countries you have moving parts of the exchange rate and the indirectness. o\tFor direct countries, the goal is Level D in their currency.  ?\tAlso, one of our MS folks shared this: the participation agreement permits the entity that signed the agreement to include non-affiliated entities in their enterprise device/user counts.  A participation agreement is typically used when the parent entity (the ?enrolled affiliate?) has the ability to direct standards for the participants/franchisees/etc.  The enrolled affiliate is responsible both for placing orders for the participant (commonly outsourced to the reseller), and they are responsible for paying the bill.  Microsoft does not invoice the individual participants.",

During normal renewal cycles, these companies historically do not move and typically raise prices that are not locked in, anywhere from 3-8% year over year.  In fact, I just finished a review, for a large Midwest Bank, that has been a customer of NICE Systems for some 8 years, , and with the exception of last year, when they did a major upgrade, and the first two renewals, where they had contractually agreed to maintenance, NICE raised their rates every year. Why not last year, because they did a major upgrade. Fast forward 365 days to this renewal, absolutely no love what so ever, 3% increase, across the board, that was the extent of their favoritism.  I have reviewed both your prior and current offers. The original offer at 60% was actually not a bad starting position, considering the size of your environment, although, the 3% increase on maintenance right out of the gate and the maintenance rate based on an initial 22% were both above FMV for certain. The 2nd iteration, at 63% discount and a flat maintenance rate, is definitely a step in the right direction. Keep it up.   The goal here should be to get closer to 70%, but that is not going to happen now and it is most likely not going to happen quickly. AFI missed the end of Q2, so you may have to hold 60-70 days to get all the way to 69-70% and it is going to take competition. Even if NICE has been eliminated, they have to be played up. Aceyus is another vendor that you can work into the conversation as is Cisco.   We can help you brainstorm and set this in motion if you need assistance.",

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  I have had this one for a while and I owe you some feedback.  Since this was a smaller deal and you were out of the office, it got moved a little lower on the priority list.  Typically Oracle renewals are not very exciting.  Often, the best case scenario for a standard Oracle renewal is to have pricing remain flat from the previous year, which is what Oracle is offering in the 18-month proposal.  So NPI considers the 18-month renewal cost to be Fair Market Value (FMV).  In the 24-month and 36-month renewals, Oracle is offering additional discounting on the Multi-tenant service, but the Java CS is maintained at a 30% discount.  NPI sees no reason that the Java service should not also see moderate reductions (or increased discounting) if CNL is going to make a longer-term commitment.  NPI recommends targeting 35% discounting on the Java CS service for the 24-month renewal ? a reduction of ~$2K.  And we recommend targeting 40% discounting on the Java CS service for the 36-month renewal ? a reduction of ~$5K.  The messaging to Oracle is fairly simple, if CNL is going to make a longer-term commitment, it will need to be worth-your-while.  If there is no reduction in the largest cost of this renewal when we make a longer-term commitment, then we may as well just renew for 1-year and see if we will still need these services each year.   UPDATE: Closing as CNL no longer a client.",

        "current_narrative": "Although the initial discounts offered by Dell EMC are respectable, NPI considers other external factors when classifying pricing and those areas should be considered in this negotiation.  NPI would typically expect to see both Hardware and Software discounted at 70% - 72% for deal of this size. Discounting at 69.5% places this pricing in the high range (and almost above FMV). ? Due to the timing of this fiscal year-end opportunity, NPI has increased the FMV target discount an additional percentage point, up to 73%. Achieving this target will result in approximately $51K in savings. ? Support is typically 20% of net HW/SW pricing for THREE years. In this offer, NPI finds that the support pricing is at 21% of HW/SW pricing, but only covers TWO years. \u00a92017 NPI, LLC. All Rights Reserved. NPI Confidential Information. May Not Be Disclosed to 3rd Parties. Page 3 ? NPI adjusted for this anomaly and increases the target discount to 82% of list for support. This discount results in a number that extrapolates out to 21% for the typical three-year term. Successfully negotiating this topic will result in approximately $39K in savings. ? Professional services is a rarely discounted line item and NPI finds that the small discounts that are seen are typically found in large deployments with large amounts of professional services. o NPI believes that these funds ARE somewhat flexible and because of the small dollar amount, NPI is applying the 23% discount that we periodically find in larger deployments to this proposal.

        "current_narrative": "Gentleman, I?ve gotten smarter on this and hope to impart that wisdom to you all.  NPI hasn?t seen this very much but it is an interesting area.  I think understanding what this does is almost as important to the negotiation as understanding your pricing specifically.   I?m hoping this is just round one of feedback and that you have a bit of time to allow me to get smarter on the pricing.  Pardon the informality of bullets but it is the quickest way to share thoughts based on my two SME conversations. Also, this is heavily Pega-focused.  Pega has several product lines.  Their traditional BPM line has been their flagship product.  Individual sales of this are routinely seven figures.  This is a value-driven product and the Account Executives that sell this product are actually somewhat distanced from how it is priced.  Pega attempts to determine the value they will drive (clients should be coached not to let them from a negotiation point of view) and then is fairly challenging to negotiate with. Everything is purpose-based and licensed for a specific use.  The negotiation can be about how to get this as broad as possible.  An average AE has only five named accounts and they land and expand.  18 months ago they bought a company called OpenSpan and this is the RPA stuff that AmFam is looking at now.  It?s being integrated into Pega of course but there?s still remnants of how OpenSpan sold this.  NPI believes this part of their business, unlike the core BPM, is more negotiable.  I?m pretty certain a list price exists for the Robotics products (RPA, RDA and Workforce Intelligence) and it can be benchmarked like most software companies.  This is unlike the core BPM offering from Pega where the value-based approach distances any offer from any of their secretive price lists.  So that?s a bit of a tease as I indicate I think this can be benchmarked but I?m not able to yet.  It does mean it is more negotiable I believe especially since you?re involving competition.  ?\tEven though it is the third license mentioned Workforce Intelligence (WI) is likely the first license you?ll use.  You don?t know what you need to fix until you use WI.  This is a small piece of software that Pega wants you to run continuously on everyone?s desk.  It?ll monitor all keystrokes, idle time and system transactions.  Are folks doing a lot of cutting and pasting between applications, for example.  You learn people in call centers are spending x% of time not doing anything, x% copying/pasting...then Pega can figure out dollar amounts you can say if you automate/improve the use of people?s time.   Pega will tell you that as you soon as you do this and things change you will want to keep improving and so you need to keep monitoring.  So WI runs out of the gate and tells you where you can automate. o\tThis is some key messaging that you will hear from Pega and will need to determine how you want to counter it.  It?ll make a ton of sense when you think about the value of continually monitoring and improving.  Who can question that, right?  However, how comprehensive does the monitoring need to be to find ongoing improvements when you?re paying for a license for each  person being monitored.  You almost have to counter with you don?t want to be overwhelmed with too much intelligence out of WI. o\tHow comprehensive you are can depend on how diverse or uniform your workforce is.  If you monitor 10 to 20 people per user group that may be enough.  Do you have 3, 7 or 15 groups that seem distinct enough in what they do so that each needs monitoring?   o\tPega will push for very comprehensive coverage during the whole 24 or 36 month term.  There are plenty of customers who will do as much as they can possible do within 18 months.  Every customer is different of course.  Is there so much anticipated improvement from Robotics that 36 months is needed.  My SME told me that EVERYONE overbuys this stuff.  Both in signing up for a term and in the number of licenses since they make you buy them in blocks.  They condition you to buy a year at a time in blocks of at least 200. Just be cognizant of that and consider being more conservative knowing the tendency. o\tI gave some thought to how long the RPA/RDA term should be (offered for 24 and 36 months) compared to WI which is offered at 12 and 24 months.  Intuitively it makes sense that you could stop monitoring at some point and start automating. It also makes sense that you could start automating your first round of recommendations (coming out of WI) and then expect to keep monitoring and get additional recommendations. AmFam needs to think about how this may play out.  If you think you only need 12 months of WI or 18 months or maybe you want to run it for 6 months and turn it off for 6 and then back on for 6, this is stuff I?m told you can broach and try to negotiate.  o\tNPI is trying to determine list price but I did find some GSA pricing. One month of Cloud, 12 month commit and 100 users was $32/month. AmFam?s offer for 200 users for 12 months is $45.50 (totals $109,200 for a year).  This should tell you there?s sizable room for improvement. Anyone can find this price list. I?m attaching for your convenience.  Real list is not published on their website but consider asking for it.  AmFam doesn?t approach GSA pricing until you buy 1000 users for 24 months. At 200 users for 12 months, achieving GSA pricing saves $36K a year.  Push for increments of 100 users as well. ?\tThe ratio of 7:1 being allowed using Robotic Units is standard and a nice ?concession?.  I have a GSA price list for Pega and saw that when comparing their RPA and RDA pricing (they are separate products being combined for AmFam) their price ratio was exactly 7:1. o\tThe flexibility to switch is nice since you don?t know what you don?t know.  Slide 4 gives a good description of RDA vs RPA.  RPA is basically automating processes that don?t have any human intervention.  RDA is adding automation to more people-driven processes.  Using WF helps you understand where you improvements are and these will then require some mix of RPA and RDA licenses. o\tNPI prefers to know list price and offer up benchmarks comparing client pricing to other observed market prices.  Since this isn?t an option yet we offer up another GSA comparison.   ?\tGSA pricing per RPA for a 1 mo. Term and 12 month commitment is $316.   AmFam?s offer for 50 RPA for 24 months is $368.75 per month.  Again, not a great comparison to GSA.  At 100 units that drops to $287.25 and to $213 for 200 units and a 36 month commitment.  The GSA price didn?t have a volume commitment and was for 12 months.   ?\tAmFam?s negotiation will pivot on the term and volume of course.  NPI believes there?s room to leverage competition to push back for a 10-25% improvement depending on the term/quantity mix. ?\tSlides 5 and 6 mention a Purpose based license of Pega Platform is included at no charge and there?s no requirement to purchase it.  This is an interesting piece.  The whole reason why they bought OpenSpan is to get these smaller opportunities in front of clients, then they can get you to taste the power of the big Platform and then sell you the $1M+ BPM offering.  Robotics improves existing processes but doesn?t outright transform them.  That?s BPM in a simplistic way.  The Robotics Studio is also included and that?s what?s used to build the Bots.  ?\tHere?s a couple interesting links to read about Robotics on their site and the acquisition o\thttps://www.pega.com/products/pega-7-platform/robotic-automation o\thttps://www.pega.com/about/news/media-coverage/pegasystems-acquires-robotic-automation-software-provider-openspan  I wanted to share as much as I could today and hope the above helps.  My SMEs didn?t know much about Automation Anywhere.  They did feel it was a less robust platform and if the prices are similar then Pega is the way to go.  We talked about it a bit and since they call stuff differently it is a little hard to know if they?re apples to apples.  None of the different counts/quantities seems to align but a lot of the functionality seemed to overlap.  Analytics Platform sounds a bit like WI. Task Bot and Meta Bot sound like RPA and RDA.  Sample year one totals $225K and there?s a level of RPA/RDA combined with WI that is close to this as well.  My SME thought it was a bit less advanced and AA wants to have someone on site to oversee all this.  He compared this to Pega who offer up free training through 12/31 for one item and other free training online as they want you to be self sufficient  and believe clients can use WI, Robotics Studio and RPA/RDA to be self sufficient.  He didn?t say this exactly but that?s my interpretation.  He said Pega is less klugy.  AA?s attitude is we?ll have someone on site to fix this for you.  You can look at that two ways.  It is nice to have a helping hand but Pega doesn?t think you?ll need it. I need to dig into this comparison a bit more.  Consider asking each vendor to talk about the differences in laymen?s terms.  Increasingly Robotics is going to take on the personality of core Pega BPM. They believe they?re the best and don?t want to leave any money on the table. They will be tough to negotiate with.  Don?t show favoritism.  Get internally aligned so there are no leaks.  Be firm that it doesn?t make sense to monitor the whole population continually, push back on some of the chunkiness of having to buy licenses in blocks, and even indicate aside from budget and competitive elements you found some GSA pricing and AmFam compares unfavorably to it.  ?There?s no way our CIO or CFO are going to approve any offer where that?s the case?",

Since this was a smaller deal and you were out of the office, it got moved a little lower on the priority list.  Typically Oracle renewals are not very exciting.  Often, the best case scenario for a standard Oracle renewal is to have pricing remain flat from the previous year, which is what Oracle is offering in the 18-month proposal.  So NPI considers the 18-month renewal cost to be Fair Market Value (FMV).  In the 24-month and 36-month renewals, Oracle is offering additional discounting on the Multi-tenant service, but the Java CS is maintained at a 30% discount.  NPI sees no reason that the Java service should not also see moderate reductions (or increased discounting) if CNL is going to make a longer-term commitment.  NPI recommends targeting 35% discounting on the Java CS service for the 24-month renewal ? a reduction of ~$2K.  And we recommend targeting 40% discounting on the Java CS service for the 36-month renewal ? a reduction of ~$5K.  The messaging to Oracle is fairly simple, if CNL is going to make a longer-term commitment, it will need to be worth-your-while.  If there is no reduction in the largest cost of this renewal when we make a longer-term commitment, then we may as well just renew for 1-year and see if we will still need these services each year.

        "current_narrative": "Gentleman, I?ve gotten smarter on this and hope to impart that wisdom to you all.  NPI hasn?t seen this very much but it is an interesting area.  I think understanding what this does is almost as important to the negotiation as understanding your pricing specifically.   I?m hoping this is just round one of feedback and that you have a bit of time to allow me to get smarter on the pricing.  Pardon the informality of bullets but it is the quickest way to share thoughts based on my two SME conversations. Also, this is heavily Pega-focused.  Pega has several product lines.  Their traditional BPM line has been their flagship product.  Individual sales of this are routinely seven figures.  This is a value-driven product and the Account Executives that sell this product are actually somewhat distanced from how it is priced.  Pega attempts to determine the value they will drive (clients should be coached not to let them from a negotiation point of view) and then is fairly challenging to negotiate with. Everything is purpose-based and licensed for a specific use.  The negotiation can be about how to get this as broad as possible.  An average AE has only five named accounts and they land and expand.  18 months ago they bought a company called OpenSpan and this is the RPA stuff that AmFam is looking at now.  It?s being integrated into Pega of course but there?s still remnants of how OpenSpan sold this.  NPI believes this part of their business, unlike the core BPM, is more negotiable.  I?m pretty certain a list price exists for the Robotics products (RPA, RDA and Workforce Intelligence) and it can be benchmarked like most software companies.  This is unlike the core BPM offering from Pega where the value-based approach distances any offer from any of their secretive price lists.  So that?s a bit of a tease as I indicate I think this can be benchmarked but I?m not able to yet.  It does mean it is more negotiable I believe especially since you?re involving competition.  ?\tEven though it is the third license mentioned Workforce Intelligence (WI) is likely the first license you?ll use.  You don?t know what you need to fix until you use WI.  This is a small piece of software that Pega wants you to run continuously on everyone?s desk.  It?ll monitor all keystrokes, idle time and system transactions.  Are folks doing a lot of cutting and pasting between applications, for example.  You learn people in call centers are spending x% of time not doing anything, x% copying/pasting...then Pega can figure out dollar amounts you can say if you automate/improve the use of people?s time.   Pega will tell you that as you soon as you do this and things change you will want to keep improving and so you need to keep monitoring.  So WI runs out of the gate and tells you where you can automate. o\tThis is some key messaging that you will hear from Pega and will need to determine how you want to counter it.  It?ll make a ton of sense when you think about the value of continually monitoring and improving.  Who can question that, right?  However, how comprehensive does the monitoring need to be to find ongoing improvements when you?re paying for a license for each  person being monitored.  You almost have to counter with you don?t want to be overwhelmed with too much intelligence out of WI. o\tHow comprehensive you are can depend on how diverse or uniform your workforce is.  If you monitor 10 to 20 people per user group that may be enough.  Do you have 3, 7 or 15 groups that seem distinct enough in what they do so that each needs monitoring?   o\tPega will push for very comprehensive coverage during the whole 24 or 36 month term.  There are plenty of customers who will do as much as they can possible do within 18 months.  Every customer is different of course.  Is there so much anticipated improvement from Robotics that 36 months is needed.  My SME told me that EVERYONE overbuys this stuff.  Both in signing up for a term and in the number of licenses since they make you buy them in blocks.  They condition you to buy a year at a time in blocks of at least 200. Just be cognizant of that and consider being more conservative knowing the tendency. o\tI gave some thought to how long the RPA/RDA term should be (offered for 24 and 36 months) compared to WI which is offered at 12 and 24 months.  Intuitively it makes sense that you could stop monitoring at some point and start automating. It also makes sense that you could start automating your first round of recommendations (coming out of WI) and then expect to keep monitoring and get additional recommendations. AmFam needs to think about how this may play out.  If you think you only need 12 months of WI or 18 months or maybe you want to run it for 6 months and turn it off for 6 and then back on for 6, this is stuff I?m told you can broach and try to negotiate.  o\tNPI is trying to determine list price but I did find some GSA pricing. One month of Cloud, 12 month commit and 100 users was $32/month. AmFam?s offer for 200 users for 12 months is $45.50 (totals $109,200 for a year).  This should tell you there?s sizable room for improvement. Anyone can find this price list. I?m attaching for your convenience.  Real list is not published on their website but consider asking for it.  AmFam doesn?t approach GSA pricing until you buy 1000 users for 24 months. At 200 users for 12 months, achieving GSA pricing saves $36K a year.  Push for increments of 100 users as well. ?\tThe ratio of 7:1 being allowed using Robotic Units is standard and a nice ?concession?.  I have a GSA price list for Pega and saw that when comparing their RPA and RDA pricing (they are separate products being combined for AmFam) their price ratio was exactly 7:1. o\tThe flexibility to switch is nice since you don?t know what you don?t know.  Slide 4 gives a good description of RDA vs RPA.  RPA is basically automating processes that don?t have any human intervention.  RDA is adding automation to more people-driven processes.  Using WF helps you understand where you improvements are and these will then require some mix of RPA and RDA licenses. o\tNPI prefers to know list price and offer up benchmarks comparing client pricing to other observed market prices.  Since this isn?t an option yet we offer up another GSA comparison.   ?\tGSA pricing per RPA for a 1 mo. Term and 12 month commitment is $316.   AmFam?s offer for 50 RPA for 24 months is $368.75 per month.  Again, not a great comparison to GSA.  At 100 units that drops to $287.25 and to $213 for 200 units and a 36 month commitment.  The GSA price didn?t have a volume commitment and was for 12 months.   ?\tAmFam?s negotiation will pivot on the term and volume of course.  NPI believes there?s room to leverage competition to push back for a 10-25% improvement depending on the term/quantity mix. ?\tSlides 5 and 6 mention a Purpose based license of Pega Platform is included at no charge and there?s no requirement to purchase it.  This is an interesting piece.  The whole reason why they bought OpenSpan is to get these smaller opportunities in front of clients, then they can get you to taste the power of the big Platform and then sell you the $1M+ BPM offering.  Robotics improves existing processes but doesn?t outright transform them.  That?s BPM in a simplistic way.  The Robotics Studio is also included and that?s what?s used to build the Bots.  ?\tHere?s a couple interesting links to read about Robotics on their site and the acquisition o\thttps://www.pega.com/products/pega-7-platform/robotic-automation o\thttps://www.pega.com/about/news/media-coverage/pegasystems-acquires-robotic-automation-software-provider-openspan  I wanted to share as much as I could today and hope the above helps.  My SMEs didn?t know much about Automation Anywhere.  They did feel it was a less robust platform and if the prices are similar then Pega is the way to go.  We talked about it a bit and since they call stuff differently it is a little hard to know if they?re apples to apples.  None of the different counts/quantities seems to align but a lot of the functionality seemed to overlap.  Analytics Platform sounds a bit like WI. Task Bot and Meta Bot sound like RPA and RDA.  Sample year one totals $225K and there?s a level of RPA/RDA combined with WI that is close to this as well.  My SME thought it was a bit less advanced and AA wants to have someone on site to oversee all this.  He compared this to Pega who offer up free training through 12/31 for one item and other free training online as they want you to be self sufficient  and believe clients can use WI, Robotics Studio and RPA/RDA to be self sufficient.  He didn?t say this exactly but that?s my interpretation.  He said Pega is less klugy.  AA?s attitude is we?ll have someone on site to fix this for you.  You can look at that two ways.  It is nice to have a helping hand but Pega doesn?t think you?ll need it. I need to dig into this comparison a bit more.  Consider asking each vendor to talk about the differences in laymen?s terms.  Increasingly Robotics is going to take on the personality of core Pega BPM. They believe they?re the best and don?t want to leave any money on the table. They will be tough to negotiate with.  Don?t show favoritism.  Get internally aligned so there are no leaks.  Be firm that it doesn?t make sense to monitor the whole population continually, push back on some of the chunkiness of having to buy licenses in blocks, and even indicate aside from budget and competitive elements you found some GSA pricing and AmFam compares unfavorably to it.  ?There?s no way our CIO or CFO are going to approve any offer where that?s the case?",

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  As I mentioned, NPI has good amount of data on Coupa, as well as a SME in our Advisor Network who also helps with reviews.  In the interest of a quick turnaround, please see notes below in lieu of a more formal document.    It appears that the document you sent over is a 2-year agreement that you signed last year.  It is not unusual that you are looking to discuss the subscription fees mid-contract because NPI has seen that many SaaS vendors are willing to discuss subscription costs off-cycle.  Sometimes, they will require an extension to the term of the contract, but they will typically agree to discuss the subscription rates.  Price Analysis and Negotiation Strategy First, a bit of history that NPI has seen with Coupa.  Prior to their IPO in October 2016, Coupa?s pricing was truly the wild-wild-west.  It was not uncommon that they would manipulate list pricing to show whatever discount percentage they wanted.  Since the IPO, as a public company with more scrutiny, they have tamed their pricing practices a bit, but NPI would not call it ?stable? pricing.  In September of 2016, Coupa hired Steve Winter, former SAP executive, as their CRO.  Steve has brought SAP?s ?keep?em guessing? pricing methodologies to Coupa.  That is, Coupa will change their pricing roughly every 90-days? maybe not wholesale changes, but name changes and moving ?bundles? around so it is difficult for the market to get a bead on their pricing.  In looking at Chico?s pricing in this 2-year agreement, using list prices that we have seen in other Coupa proposals for the 4 included applications, we believe this proposal is discounted between 35% - 50%.  NPI considers this level of discounting to be in the range of Fair Market Value (FMV).  Chico?s may want to ask Coupa for list pricing for this proposal to see what they are claiming is the discount percentage.  Coupa will often push back on providing list price and if they provide it, it will need to be taken with a grain of salt ? see notes above about constant changes in pricing.  Having said the above we would also add that, based on the competitive landscape of the market, NPI believes there may be at least some small savings on this contract.  There are literally hundreds of  vendors that will do ?3-bids and a buy? functionality that Coupa sees as competitors to their S2P environment.  Even though many are not as robust as Coupa, they are credible enough to be a threat.  A message along the lines of, ?Verian (now part of Basware) has been courting us and as we?ve been evaluating their product, it appears it will satisfy most of our requirements at nearly half the cost.?, will get Coupa?s attention.  Other competitors worth mentioning: Jagger (formerly Sciquest), Zycus, Determine, GEP.  If Coupa asks for a target reduction, NPI recommends setting a target of a 20% reduction, but any improvement at all on this pricing is really icing on the cake.  Closing as FMV ... significant scope change - cut user count in half and paying more than initial quote.  Coupa recently (May 2017) acquired a company called Trade Extensions.  Trade Extensions is a top-of-the-line trading platform and significantly improves on the ?3-bids and a buy? functionality.  If Coupa offers to throw Trade Extensions in, NPI considers that a big concession.",

We have only seen a handful of BrightEdge transactions, but I was able to do some comparative analysis on the discount percentage.  Overall, last year?s purchase at 40% discounting is well within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV) for a BrightEdge purchase of this size.  We have actually seen a few larger BrightEdge deals that have maxed out in the mid- 40%?s discounting, so we consider 40% for a $60K list price purchase to be FMV.  Since BrightEdge has held the pricing flat AND included additional Domains and Google Analytics connects, NPI continues to believe that this pricing is well within FMV.

        "current_narrative": "Findings and Recommendations NPI reviewed REI?s Kronos proposal and found the pricing for the add-on software subscriptions to be Fair Market Value (FMV) based on comparisons to similar transactions. The pricing for the ?Professional and Educational Services? were noted to be Above FMV.  Pricing Analysis ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions.   Workforce Budgeting & Analytics Kronos has a large footprint at REI, but even in the context of larger spend the pricing is very good and appears historical pricing has carried to the current proposal before contract consolidation next year. ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be FMV.  o\tWhile Kronos does not publish list pricing, NPI has numerous deals in our database providing the ability to make comparisons, and by our estimates, your quote is discounted at ~80%+ which NPI considers to be solidly FMV. ?\tMarket range is typically between $.8 and $1.5 so clearly REI is getting solid pricing given these are add-on purchases.

Kronos rack rates start at $200 per hour (blended). ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be Above FMV. ?\tCurrently, your blended hourly rate stands at ~$213, which we would expect for someone with far less of a landscape than what REI has. o\tNPI provided target discounts as shown in the table below, returning a nominal additional savings of $1,078 (blended rate of ~$180).

Indicate that you have done your market research (talking to colleagues, or a new REI executive who has experience with Kronos consulting), and you were expecting a blended rate closer to $175 - $180 per hour and to match prior contracts.  ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially for the add-on subscriptions. While that is evident in the subscription add-on, there is room for improvement on hourly rates.   Determined licenses were FMV but install rates were above FMV with targets provided",

This did not lend itself to a full FMV document, but if you need a more formal document, I can put something together for you.  ?\tOverall, the discounting on years 1 & 2, at ~39% is some of the best discounting we?ve seen.  This is a Corporate VP level discount within Microsoft. o\tWe have other, larger Microsoft clients that are not able to get to that discount level. o\tWe suspect that a combination of a) your relatively low dollar commit, b) only purchasing Core CAL?s, and c) Chico?s next big purchase will be in 2-years with the EA renewal, makes Chico?s a ?target for opportunity? within Microsoft.  Microsoft will be looking to significantly increase the revenue they get from Chico?s, either by adding on new products, or significantly reducing your discount levels at the time of the EA renewal. ?\tIt is common that Microsoft is trying to ramp down the 3rd year discount to 20%.  NPI recommends that you push hard for consistency across all 3-years. ?\tYou will want to be sure to have a ?Not to Exceed? (NTE) clause added to this contract so that the renewal cost does not exceed either CPI or CAGR.  We recommend that you target a NTE 3% increase (over 3-years), but Microsoft will most likely settle on 6% - 10%. ?\tChico?s is receiving solid additional funding in Deployment Funds, CSM, and Fast Track, etc.  There may be even more funding available, but Chico?s would have to tie it to some specific project.  So, overall, Year 1 & 2 pricing are very good.  We recommend that you push for 3rd year consistency and add the NTE.  At that point, Chico?s could move forward with confidence on this purchase.",

NPI would typically expect to see both Hardware and Software discounted at 70% - 72% for deal of this size. Discounting at 69.5% places this pricing in the high range (and almost above FMV). ? Due to the timing of this fiscal year-end opportunity, NPI has increased the FMV target discount an additional percentage point, up to 73%. Achieving this target will result in approximately $51K in savings. ? Support is typically 20% of net HW/SW pricing for THREE years.

May Not Be Disclosed to 3rd Parties. Page 3 ? NPI adjusted for this anomaly and increases the target discount to 82% of list for support. This discount results in a number that extrapolates out to 21% for the typical three-year term. Successfully negotiating this topic will result in approximately $39K in savings. ? Professional services is a rarely discounted line item and NPI finds that the small discounts that are seen are typically found in large deployments with large amounts of professional services. o NPI believes that these funds ARE somewhat flexible and because of the small dollar amount, NPI is applying the 23% discount that we periodically find in larger deployments to this proposal.

The SCE does provide some automatic discounting on perpetual licensing, but at this size of a net spend across multiple agreements, those discounts do not push pricing into the range of FMV.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI strongly recommends not mentioning specific discounts off the Level C reference pricing.  Microsoft is notorious for standing up to requests that solely revolve around discounts; they are typically much more receptive when clients speak to the larger 3-year TCO plus address the financial exposure risks of the SCE?s encompassing licensing rules. ?\tNPI recommends getting Microsoft to focus on an even budgetary goal of getting the spend under a $6.75M target for the term ($2.25M annual) in exchange for an expedited deal approval that preserves a March signature timeline. ?\tNPI notes that these targets are more conservative to reflect the smaller timeframe available for this deal.  o\tMore aggressive targets would be appropriate with multiple months available for negotiations, but NPI has seen success even within shorter periods.  o\tIf Freddie Mac feels the sales team is especially nervous about landing this deal, it is feasible to pursue a more aggressive price target.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed BJC?s combined hardware and software maintenance and found pricing to be within fair market value (FMV) for the overall spend.  The majority of the spend falls under XIV storage, with XIV hardware (26%) and software (39%) comprising the majority of the spend (65%).  That ratio goes up further (71%) if Technical Advisors related to XIV are included (6%).  Analyzing hardware in this space requires greater granular configuration data for the equipment covered and can be an exacting process.  BJC?s configuration data may sway FMV analysis slightly, but there are sufficient commoditized hardware, software, and service items in the provided spreadsheet to complete a more exacting assessment.  Current price increases over the previous 5-Year term are within FMV guidelines that target anything lower than 5% annual, with BJC?s totals at nearly 4% when comparing previous and current 5-year totals.  While the overall spend is within FMV guidelines, XIV and Pseries hardware are ripe for third-party maintainers once assets are off initial support, and as a result IBM faces pricing pressure in the current market.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tBJC?s pricing is at FMV for bottom-line costs, even with increase over previous annual rates.  Addressing cost increases that did exceed 20% is the first recommended savings target, as FMV rate increase of 15% (3% per year of the previous term) are more in line with this sizable operating cost.   ?\tEquipment nearly end of life or items that may otherwise be covered by SMS can be targeted as areas for most aggressive savings expectations.  Got final doc.  Did a serial number search and compared final cost to the three year offer.  The spreadsheet had a bunch of scenarios.  Seemed like the right comparison.  Shown in Excel.  Changed contract to 8908 since we didn't get to show this in prior year and was so close. likely didn't get acted on til after new contract started.",

The pricing for the ?Professional and Educational Services? were noted to be Above FMV.  Pricing Analysis ?\tKronos, having successfully transitioned to a pure software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, delivered strong growth in the Kronos Cloud last year, with their subscription revenue increasing 45 percent.  ?\tKronos is continuing to add hundreds of customers to the Kronos Cloud (both existing customers with Kronos perpetual licenses as well as new customers).  ?\tKronos also appears to have raised the list pricing for a few products.  ?\tAs is the case with many other SaaS vendors, Kronos has been re-bundling and renaming several products, as well as adding new features and functionality.  ?\tPricing varies based on factors such as total spend, volume, customer requirements and negotiation leverage, and quantity of perpetual licenses owned by the customers prior to signing up for the SaaS subscriptions.   Workforce Budgeting & Analytics Kronos has a large footprint at REI, but even in the context of larger spend the pricing is very good and appears historical pricing has carried to the current proposal before contract consolidation next year. ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be FMV.  o\tWhile Kronos does not publish list pricing, NPI has numerous deals in our database providing the ability to make comparisons, and by our estimates, your quote is discounted at ~80%+ which NPI considers to be solidly FMV. ?\tMarket range is typically between $.8 and $1.5 so clearly REI is getting solid pricing given these are add-on purchases.

Kronos rack rates start at $200 per hour (blended). ?\tNPI reviewed current pricing as proposed and determined it to be Above FMV. ?\tCurrently, your blended hourly rate stands at ~$213, which we would expect for someone with far less of a landscape than what REI has. o\tNPI provided target discounts as shown in the table below, returning a nominal additional savings of $1,078 (blended rate of ~$180).

Indicate that you have done your market research (talking to colleagues, or a new REI executive who has experience with Kronos consulting), and you were expecting a blended rate closer to $175 - $180 per hour and to match prior contracts.  ?\tKronos rewards customers for buying add-on software and typically offers better pricing and discounts initially for the add-on subscriptions. While that is evident in the subscription add-on, there is room for improvement on hourly rates.   Determined licenses were FMV but install rates were above FMV with targets provided",

        "current_narrative": "Hi Jennifer, Thanks for sending your add-on license purchase for review.  I see Aspect is using the same negotiation tactic as they did in 2016 where they started with a 30% discount and ended with 40%.  That purchase had an extended list price of $300K for licenses while this purchase is at $235K.  The 5% uplift is possible as our last review for Aspect was right at the end of 2017 and Aspect doesn?t publish a price list.  That 2017 review had list prices that matched the ones being shown/offered to Progressive.   They hadn?t raised their prices in a couple of years and my guess is just before your last purchase in 2016 there had been a recent 10% increase.  The Aspect story has changed little: they?ve moved from leader to niche player in the latest Gartner report (Feb 2018), mainly focused on existing clients.  Progressive in effect are investing dollars into the enhancement of a SaaS solution you don't own.  My SME advises postponing the buy if possible (maybe not feasible) and survey the market for better solution and a lower TCO.  Of course, this is a mouthful and easier said than done.  However, it could generate some talking points in support of your negotiation.  Ask about the R&D into the perpetual license solution.  The talent on the R&D and Support side can?t be focused on Progressive?s solution.  Push hard for specifics.  Has the release schedule slowed down?  Less in each release?  Any more major releases expected?  While leverage may not be on your side, this allows you to push for better pricing on this as you double your footprint.  It just makes common sense.  If they indicate less R&D and fewer releases then why are they trying to raise prices.  Feels like they are milking the old product while they furiously work on their SaaS offering.   Focusing back on the commercial terms, we continue to expect to see Mission Critical Maintenance at 22% and Business Day Maintenance at 20%.  This is where Progressive landed in 2016 and that?s the current offer.  It is small dollars but you?d kind of expect the gap to be bigger i.e., Business Day to be 18% vs. MC at 22%; however, they?ve been consistent.  Along the same negotiation points noted above, if Progressive feels as though support is deteriorating and software releases are less robust and fewer and far between that is reason enough to push for a lower percentage.  Maintenance costs are comprised of phone support and software releases and patches so if any aspect is weakening then customers have the right to push for relief.  During our last review we noted that they just emerged from bankruptcy and were struggling to rollout  a cloud offering.  We suggested a 50%+ target but the leverage worked against Progressive and you topped off at 40%.  This feels like a rinse-and-repeat scenario.  40% feels a bit low in light of market conditions and the 2x growth.  NPI suggests targeting a 50% final discount which typically requires pushing for more than that to allow for the compromise.  Achieving a 50% discount drives $23,500 out of license spend and about $3,500 out of support. Driving Mission Critical support to 20% would save an additional $2500.",

NPI would typically expect to see both Hardware and Software discounted at 70% - 72% for deal of this size. Discounting at 69.5% places this pricing in the high range (and almost above FMV). ? Due to the timing of this fiscal year-end opportunity, NPI has increased the FMV target discount an additional percentage point, up to 73%. Achieving this target will result in approximately $51K in savings. ? Support is typically 20% of net HW/SW pricing for THREE years. In this offer, NPI finds that the support pricing is at 21% of HW/SW pricing, but only covers TWO years. \u00a92017 NPI, LLC. All Rights Reserved. NPI Confidential Information. May Not Be Disclosed to 3rd Parties. Page 3 ? NPI adjusted for this anomaly and increases the target discount to 82% of list for support. This discount results in a number that extrapolates out to 21% for the typical three-year term. Successfully negotiating this topic will result in approximately $39K in savings. ? Professional services is a rarely discounted line item and NPI finds that the small discounts that are seen are typically found in large deployments with large amounts of professional services. o NPI believes that these funds ARE somewhat flexible and because of the small dollar amount, NPI is applying the 23% discount that we periodically find in larger deployments to this proposal.

Should BJC pursue the B2C option and shift the licensing structure for portions of the spend, NPI notes that more aggressive FMV pricing targets would exist compared to similar transformational agreements.  BJC?s precedent pricing in this space holds a good foundation and does not support much targeted cost savings on the BAU renewal, especially considering concessions made around costs for existing Spectrum licenses.  New demand around Watson, DashDB, Cloud subscriptions and other analytics items are the main area where pricing came in above FMV, holding the greatest area of savings opportunity in either option.  Given the limited timeframe, savings targets for the BAU renewal remain conservative.  The B2C proposal as offered is not as aggressive compared to other NPI reviews of this like, and if BJC pursues this option, utilizing an even $1.5M budgetary figure would move the spend further into FMV ranges.  IBM?s fiscal year end in December means that any lingering business without definite indications of a close will have teams at Sirius and the vendor under pressure from executives, especially if they believe budgetary restrictions jeopardize the deal.",

        "current_narrative": "When it comes to Verint (or NICE or Aceyus or any other major IVR player), you have two opportunities to get your pricing right, new purchases, and significant upgrades, and that is it. During normal renewal cycles, these companies historically do not move and typically raise prices that are not locked in, anywhere from 3-8% year over year.  In fact, I just finished a review, for a large Midwest Bank, that has been a customer of NICE Systems for some 8 years, , and with the exception of last year, when they did a major upgrade, and the first two renewals, where they had contractually agreed to maintenance, NICE raised their rates every year. Why not last year, because they did a major upgrade. Fast forward 365 days to this renewal, absolutely no love what so ever, 3% increase, across the board, that was the extent of their favoritism.  I have reviewed both your prior and current offers. The original offer at 60% was actually not a bad starting position, considering the size of your environment, although, the 3% increase on maintenance right out of the gate and the maintenance rate based on an initial 22% were both above FMV for certain. The 2nd iteration, at 63% discount and a flat maintenance rate, is definitely a step in the right direction. Keep it up.   The goal here should be to get closer to 70%, but that is not going to happen now and it is most likely not going to happen quickly. AFI missed the end of Q2, so you may have to hold 60-70 days to get all the way to 69-70% and it is going to take competition. Even if NICE has been eliminated, they have to be played up. Aceyus is another vendor that you can work into the conversation as is Cisco.   We can help you brainstorm and set this in motion if you need assistance.",

They came down on licensing, Professional Services and of course Support and Maintenance from the first pricing breakdown also included on the attached.  Thanks for your help.  No interest in SaaS. Asked about that discount to capture it   Seemed to say he had a verbal for 70% on perpetual but Mike did review and landed at 63%.  From Pat: Revised quote is forthcoming but the one you posted is the latest.   The difference will be a license fees drop from $400K to $367, Support and Maintenance drops from $264K over 3 years to $220,200 and Professional Services drops from $125K (estimated) to $112.5  Yes, this is the key stuff; perpetual current state.  We did look at SaaS and it is cost prohibitive mostly because both Verint and Nices? solution are not true SaaS.  They both essentially are hosted in their own environment.

        "current_narrative": "Gentleman, I?ve gotten smarter on this and hope to impart that wisdom to you all.  NPI hasn?t seen this very much but it is an interesting area.  I think understanding what this does is almost as important to the negotiation as understanding your pricing specifically.   I?m hoping this is just round one of feedback and that you have a bit of time to allow me to get smarter on the pricing.  Pardon the informality of bullets but it is the quickest way to share thoughts based on my two SME conversations. Also, this is heavily Pega-focused.  Pega has several product lines.  Their traditional BPM line has been their flagship product.  Individual sales of this are routinely seven figures.  This is a value-driven product and the Account Executives that sell this product are actually somewhat distanced from how it is priced.  Pega attempts to determine the value they will drive (clients should be coached not to let them from a negotiation point of view) and then is fairly challenging to negotiate with. Everything is purpose-based and licensed for a specific use.  The negotiation can be about how to get this as broad as possible.  An average AE has only five named accounts and they land and expand.  18 months ago they bought a company called OpenSpan and this is the RPA stuff that AmFam is looking at now.  It?s being integrated into Pega of course but there?s still remnants of how OpenSpan sold this.  NPI believes this part of their business, unlike the core BPM, is more negotiable.  I?m pretty certain a list price exists for the Robotics products (RPA, RDA and Workforce Intelligence) and it can be benchmarked like most software companies.  This is unlike the core BPM offering from Pega where the value-based approach distances any offer from any of their secretive price lists.  So that?s a bit of a tease as I indicate I think this can be benchmarked but I?m not able to yet.  It does mean it is more negotiable I believe especially since you?re involving competition.  ?\tEven though it is the third license mentioned Workforce Intelligence (WI) is likely the first license you?ll use.  You don?t know what you need to fix until you use WI.  This is a small piece of software that Pega wants you to run continuously on everyone?s desk.  It?ll monitor all keystrokes, idle time and system transactions.  Are folks doing a lot of cutting and pasting between applications, for example.  You learn people in call centers are spending x% of time not doing anything, x% copying/pasting...then Pega can figure out dollar amounts you can say if you automate/improve the use of people?s time.   Pega will tell you that as you soon as you do this and things change you will want to keep improving and so you need to keep monitoring.  So WI runs out of the gate and tells you where you can automate. o\tThis is some key messaging that you will hear from Pega and will need to determine how you want to counter it.  It?ll make a ton of sense when you think about the value of continually monitoring and improving.  Who can question that, right?  However, how comprehensive does the monitoring need to be to find ongoing improvements when you?re paying for a license for each  person being monitored.  You almost have to counter with you don?t want to be overwhelmed with too much intelligence out of WI. o\tHow comprehensive you are can depend on how diverse or uniform your workforce is.  If you monitor 10 to 20 people per user group that may be enough.  Do you have 3, 7 or 15 groups that seem distinct enough in what they do so that each needs monitoring?   o\tPega will push for very comprehensive coverage during the whole 24 or 36 month term.  There are plenty of customers who will do as much as they can possible do within 18 months.  Every customer is different of course.  Is there so much anticipated improvement from Robotics that 36 months is needed.  My SME told me that EVERYONE overbuys this stuff.  Both in signing up for a term and in the number of licenses since they make you buy them in blocks.  They condition you to buy a year at a time in blocks of at least 200. Just be cognizant of that and consider being more conservative knowing the tendency. o\tI gave some thought to how long the RPA/RDA term should be (offered for 24 and 36 months) compared to WI which is offered at 12 and 24 months.  Intuitively it makes sense that you could stop monitoring at some point and start automating. It also makes sense that you could start automating your first round of recommendations (coming out of WI) and then expect to keep monitoring and get additional recommendations. AmFam needs to think about how this may play out.  If you think you only need 12 months of WI or 18 months or maybe you want to run it for 6 months and turn it off for 6 and then back on for 6, this is stuff I?m told you can broach and try to negotiate.  o\tNPI is trying to determine list price but I did find some GSA pricing. One month of Cloud, 12 month commit and 100 users was $32/month. AmFam?s offer for 200 users for 12 months is $45.50 (totals $109,200 for a year).  This should tell you there?s sizable room for improvement. Anyone can find this price list. I?m attaching for your convenience.  Real list is not published on their website but consider asking for it.  AmFam doesn?t approach GSA pricing until you buy 1000 users for 24 months. At 200 users for 12 months, achieving GSA pricing saves $36K a year.  Push for increments of 100 users as well. ?\tThe ratio of 7:1 being allowed using Robotic Units is standard and a nice ?concession?.  I have a GSA price list for Pega and saw that when comparing their RPA and RDA pricing (they are separate products being combined for AmFam) their price ratio was exactly 7:1. o\tThe flexibility to switch is nice since you don?t know what you don?t know.  Slide 4 gives a good description of RDA vs RPA.  RPA is basically automating processes that don?t have any human intervention.  RDA is adding automation to more people-driven processes.  Using WF helps you understand where you improvements are and these will then require some mix of RPA and RDA licenses. o\tNPI prefers to know list price and offer up benchmarks comparing client pricing to other observed market prices.  Since this isn?t an option yet we offer up another GSA comparison.   ?\tGSA pricing per RPA for a 1 mo. Term and 12 month commitment is $316.   AmFam?s offer for 50 RPA for 24 months is $368.75 per month.  Again, not a great comparison to GSA.  At 100 units that drops to $287.25 and to $213 for 200 units and a 36 month commitment.  The GSA price didn?t have a volume commitment and was for 12 months.   ?\tAmFam?s negotiation will pivot on the term and volume of course.  NPI believes there?s room to leverage competition to push back for a 10-25% improvement depending on the term/quantity mix. ?\tSlides 5 and 6 mention a Purpose based license of Pega Platform is included at no charge and there?s no requirement to purchase it.  This is an interesting piece.  The whole reason why they bought OpenSpan is to get these smaller opportunities in front of clients, then they can get you to taste the power of the big Platform and then sell you the $1M+ BPM offering.  Robotics improves existing processes but doesn?t outright transform them.  That?s BPM in a simplistic way.  The Robotics Studio is also included and that?s what?s used to build the Bots.  ?\tHere?s a couple interesting links to read about Robotics on their site and the acquisition o\thttps://www.pega.com/products/pega-7-platform/robotic-automation o\thttps://www.pega.com/about/news/media-coverage/pegasystems-acquires-robotic-automation-software-provider-openspan  I wanted to share as much as I could today and hope the above helps.  My SMEs didn?t know much about Automation Anywhere.  They did feel it was a less robust platform and if the prices are similar then Pega is the way to go.  We talked about it a bit and since they call stuff differently it is a little hard to know if they?re apples to apples.  None of the different counts/quantities seems to align but a lot of the functionality seemed to overlap.  Analytics Platform sounds a bit like WI. Task Bot and Meta Bot sound like RPA and RDA.  Sample year one totals $225K and there?s a level of RPA/RDA combined with WI that is close to this as well.  My SME thought it was a bit less advanced and AA wants to have someone on site to oversee all this.  He compared this to Pega who offer up free training through 12/31 for one item and other free training online as they want you to be self sufficient  and believe clients can use WI, Robotics Studio and RPA/RDA to be self sufficient.  He didn?t say this exactly but that?s my interpretation.  He said Pega is less klugy.  AA?s attitude is we?ll have someone on site to fix this for you.  You can look at that two ways.  It is nice to have a helping hand but Pega doesn?t think you?ll need it. I need to dig into this comparison a bit more.  Consider asking each vendor to talk about the differences in laymen?s terms.  Increasingly Robotics is going to take on the personality of core Pega BPM. They believe they?re the best and don?t want to leave any money on the table. They will be tough to negotiate with.  Don?t show favoritism.  Get internally aligned so there are no leaks.  Be firm that it doesn?t make sense to monitor the whole population continually, push back on some of the chunkiness of having to buy licenses in blocks, and even indicate aside from budget and competitive elements you found some GSA pricing and AmFam compares unfavorably to it.  ?There?s no way our CIO or CFO are going to approve any offer where that?s the case?",

Discounting is poor in each category for a $2M+ annual spend, and the 0% discount on subscription items is consistent with a 0% rate on subscriptions in Freddie Mac?s larger EAS. The SCE does provide some automatic discounting on perpetual licensing, but at this size of a net spend across multiple agreements, those discounts do not push pricing into the range of FMV.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI strongly recommends not mentioning specific discounts off the Level C reference pricing.  Microsoft is notorious for standing up to requests that solely revolve around discounts; they are typically much more receptive when clients speak to the larger 3-year TCO plus address the financial exposure risks of the SCE?s encompassing licensing rules. ?\tNPI recommends getting Microsoft to focus on an even budgetary goal of getting the spend under a $6.75M target for the term ($2.25M annual) in exchange for an expedited deal approval that preserves a March signature timeline. ?\tNPI notes that these targets are more conservative to reflect the smaller timeframe available for this deal.  o\tMore aggressive targets would be appropriate with multiple months available for negotiations, but NPI has seen success even within shorter periods.  o\tIf Freddie Mac feels the sales team is especially nervous about landing this deal, it is feasible to pursue a more aggressive price target.",

        "current_narrative": "Robert, Hey there.  Must be something about this space and how their vendors conceal their list prices.  I guess as security companies they are practicing what they preach ?.  While we?ve seen several Vormetric deals the SKUs often vary across our reviews and they don?t always show list pricing.  However, they do at times so we know they will provide it if asked.  Again, we got resourceful and tried to work through this and also leverage some public data.  I just got to a point where I think we are better off asking Trace3 to show add more transparency in their quote.  I think the SKUs are correct so that?s some good news.  The attached Excel file shows the work in progress.  I haven?t suggested targets yet since there?s too many open items.  Of note:  ?\tVOR-TE ? listed for $6K about 12 months ago.  Let?s confirm this.  You may also want to take this time and ask about the bundled list price (and even net) that includes the Transparent Encryption Agent, Application Encryption and Tokenization. Another client bought the bundle (at MUCH bigger volumes ? 1,500) but paid $1K for each bundle. Webster is at $3,150 for just TE. You?re at less than 2% of their volume but I?m curious what they?d offer and it may be good to know if that?s on your roadmap.  If only two of these are of interest I don?t think they have a bundle for that but you could ask.  This other client didn?t have the Tokenization Client license so perhaps they?re configuring their solution differently than Webster. o\tThe quantity of 25 for VOR-TE and VOR-VTE-LTD brings up another topic to push for clarity on. From the limited pricing I?ve seen there?s a clear example on their Data Encryption Agent license where the first one is $6K, ten cost $45K (or $4500 each) and 25 cost $100K or $4K each).  I think now is the time to make sure they show you what all these tiers look like to ensure you?re getting both the programmatic volume discount and the additional discount you?d get on a first-time competitive buy. ?\tVOR-VTE-LTD ? the one item I had no traction finding list pricing for ?\tVOR-TOKEN ? educated guess is this is also at $6K list ?\tThe DSM Enterprise Parts I believe have the same list and they just discount non-prod more than prod.  The list could be $30K or something north of $40K.  That reflects quite a swing in discounting so it is a key item to validate.  I?d be appreciative if you could also ask them for the list price of the physical DSM Enterprise equivalent. Perhaps you could say someone asked about that option and you wanted to understand it more.  I think it lists for at least $5K more. ?\tOn the Support side, Standard is always 18% of net and Premium is 22%.  We?ve never seen Premium+ which is what?s reflected on your quote.  Below is a picture of the comparison of these two in their SW Lic Agreement.  They?re offering the + at 23% of the total hardware and software net.  Doesn?t sound like a bad uplift over Premium assuming you?re getting something more.  Consider your options there.  ?\tSome services details are shown. o\tVormetric?s rack rate is $2,500/day. VOR-PRO-SERV is the SKU.  We?ve seen it not discounted typically.   o\tProgram Review and Roadmap Dev seems like it?ll be work done by Trace3 for a fixed fee of $51,800. They mention a Security Architect and PM. No hours are mentioned.   We?d expect this to reflect some hourly estimate applied against the rates and then a 10-20% uplift for the risk involved with a fixed fee engagement.  Maybe ask about a T&M to get exposure to the rates and effort. o\tProduct Install appears to be Vormetric people.  Offered at $12,500 that?s 5 days at their $2,500 rack rate.  That number of days doesn?t seem bloated.  In a competitive environment feels like that could be something to push for free. o\tTech Design and Impl - $67,500 for 6 weeks. That?s $11,250 a week or $2,250 a day if one resource which is exactly 10% off the Vormetric daily rack rate of $2500. It includes an Architect, Engineer and PM but again is offered at a fixed amount so no effort/hours noted.  Push for some clarity around this.  Is this Trace3 or Vormetric. On the one hand you?d expect a lower rate with Trace3 but oftentimes partners bring more senior resources to bear than the OEM/Publisher. o\tRoadmap and Mentoring is offered at $51,800 and is T&M. It is largely an architect at $300.  We can benchmark this.  Is this Trace3 or Vormetric.  We?ll work on what we can but let me know if you expect to reach out to Trace3 for this additional detail.  Now is the time and no reason to spend this money if there?s any questions about the transparency of the offer.  Also, do you expect future growth.  Getting transparency now sets you up for that.",
        "customer_comments": "Went with Vormetric.  Final quote increased in size largely due to Token Server Client item growing from 1 to 18.  The only reductions appear to be on the DSM units as both the Prod and non prod had reductions.  Maintenance also dropped from 23% to 20%.   The initial quotes didn't clear show all the non prod info that was shown in the final.  Estimating savings and new baseline but not overthinking it.  Future folks should use the final docs (also some list pricing in XLS) and new SME.",

From my first pass I can tell you the Trace3 (Vormetric) SOW is too light on details.  There?s a lot ($530K+) of services with no resources, rates and hours so it can?t be benchmarked.  There?s also a sizable placeholder for hardware, licenses and support for $501K with no detail.

        "current_narrative": "Matt and Jon, Here?s what I can tell you upon first blush. ?\tA five year term is kind of rare to see.  Typically is three years and have heard WD has balked at five years as that doesn?t allow for increases after the typical three year term.  That?s a plus. ?\tNPI interprets the 63 month term as that is WDs approach to handling the usual customer objection about doublepaying i.e., paying for Workday while still on the current solution.  While we don?t see six months free granted too often this is a case where we?d suggest pushing for that i.e., 66 month term for same cost.  This is a two year project at least.  This is likely one of the first hospitals to be going all-in (HCM plus Financials) with Workday.  HIPAA concerns and capital intensive nature of hospitals have not been a great proving ground in the past for WD and SaaS.  They?re likely pushing for this to be a referenceable account. The comprehensiveness of this purchase should make the case that you need six months at no cost.  Adding term to the end is how WD addresses that. ?\tWD is increasing bundling their subscriptions making it difficult to benchmark without doing some reverse engineering.  CHOP should consider pushing for each subscription to have its own cost.  What if you want to grow (or keep) only 4 of the 6 bundled items in the third subscription? ?\tTo try and evaluate NPI viewed this as a five year term. That?s $2.4M a year for 5 years.  NPI also took the blended FSE average since there?s some growth forecast after month 15. ?\tThe FSE conversion table on p.3 is the typical table they use.  ?\tNPI then applied our typical analysis to see if using the FSE averages ( first table below) and our pricing expectations we could back into your $2.4M annual cost.  One key assumption we often make when trying to unbundle when there?s no line item aggregate pricing is that the Additional Subscription Fee table on P.1 reflects the same price for add-on FSEs as offered for the initial FSEs. This is generally a safe assumption. ?\tAt 13,000+ FSEs a price of $38.18 (again assuming this add?l FSE cost is the same as the original cost) is VERY strong for the core HCM subscription.  We?d generally expect that FSE level to land between $40-50 and maybe a bit higher if WD was feeling confident.  We would say this is toward the low end of our fair market value (FMV) range. ?\tWhen NPI evaluates Workday we first form an opinion on HCM and then all other modules are generally priced as a percentage of HCM.  o\tCCB and USP are combined.  We generally expect CCB to be at 25-30% of HCM and USP to be at 65-75% of HCM.  Using 25% and 75%, you?d then expect the combined bundle to equal the HCM cost.  It is close as HCM is $38.18 and CCB/USP is $40.61. This passes the sniff test but has some room for improvement.  o\tNPI would target HCM to stay flat; CCB at 25% and USP at 75%.  That would put CCB at $9.55 and USP at $28.64. This totals $38.18.  Achieving $38.18 drives $25-30K out of the annualized expense. o\tThe last part is a super SKU with 6 items bundled in.  Again, tough to reverse engineer.  The cost is 275% of the HCM SKU ($104.99 vs. $34.18). o\tNPI encourages CHOP to get this unbundled.  WD can be weird about it but will if pushed hard enough. o\tHistorically CCB was included with HCM. Here?s where there?s some art and science with a benchmark.  CCB is carved out largely to make HCM look smaller but historically something like FIN was priced at about 100% of HCM (when it included CCB).  That?s the approach NPI took with this review.  ?\tWe would expect FIN to be 100% of the combined HCM and CCB per FSE costs or $47.73 ($38.18 + $9.55) ?\tWe?ve never seen Grants before but newer subscriptions are generally at 25% of HCM to start ?\tWe?ve seen Projects bundled often with HCM ?\tWD has done a good job making it murkier to determine the right percentages ?\tUsing 100% for FIN and 25% for all the others (knowing a couple are likely a bit higher) and basing our expected costs as a percentage of HCM + CCB yields the second table below.  With more time NPI could likely vet these percentages of HCM further (but push WD to provide).   o\tOur calculation tallies $2.34M a year ($11.7M over the term).  This provides a nice sanity check that the $2.4M is in the ballpark of fair market value. It would be great to fine tune the percentages against line item pricing from WD.   o\tHopefully NPIs assumptions make sense. o\tThis is a lot to implement. CHOP should argue that without the deal of the century why should you prebuy all this stuff.  This is really comprehensive. o\tTarget 6 months free (i.e., 66 month term). o\tTarget $11.3 -11.5M as the annual cost but at this 5000 foot dive analysis $11.5-11.7M would be a solid landing spot. o\tExecute knowing $38.18 for HCM is stout at this FSE level.

ServiceNow customers face many challenges that are common with enterprise SaaS providers. The solution can grow rapidly and the vendor is notorious for levying heavy automatic price hikes if left unchecked.  ServiceNow continues to develop new offerings, and although CRL only anticipates the two license types, NPI expects the vendor will try to upsell different areas of your organization. If CRL considers adding any products to this proposal, NPI suggests using that additional demand as a point of leverage by positioning them as ?nice-to-haves? that could be left off due to cost considerations. ServiceNow?s next fiscal quarter end is this month (March), and CRL?s offer to ServiceNow could provide key incentives to sales team quotas.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI strongly recommends not mentioning specific discounts.  ServiceNow is notorious for standing up to requests that solely revolve around discounts; they are typically much more receptive when clients speak to the long-term solution TCO, especially as it relates to pricing allowing for growth and new products.   ?\tNPI recommends getting ServiceNow to focus on getting the combined spend under an even $325K target annually in exchange for an expedited deal approval that can accommodate a March signature timeline.  A fallback of $350k (a flat 45% discount) is appropriate.",

Software pricing is solidly within the range of FMV, but maintenance costs have room for improvement based on NPI?s data and similar reviews.  NPI sees the greatest factors of leverage in similarly-sized Kofax spends to be timing pressure and the degree of open competition involved.  Without both of those factors, it is difficult but still feasible to achieve savings targets. If Kofax already knows they?re the preferred vendor and/or no credible threat exists, NPI recommends manifesting uncertainty around this decision point.  Ideally, BNYM should float a high-level net target to the reseller and follow this with a short break in communication to make the vendors nervous about this forecasted deal.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI suggests using a rounded net amount of $800k as a talking point with the reseller and vendor, and to avoid mentioning any specific discounting. Say that this is the target needed to keep this within the March timeframe. o\tMessaging can focus on attaining a slight relief on capital costs, but also emphasize that high relative operational expenses are the main factor causing BNYM to pause before proceeding with this purchase.",

        "current_narrative": "Matt and Jon, Here?s what I can tell you upon first blush. ?\tA five year term is kind of rare to see.  Typically is three years and have heard WD has balked at five years as that doesn?t allow for increases after the typical three year term.  That?s a plus. ?\tNPI interprets the 63 month term as that is WDs approach to handling the usual customer objection about doublepaying i.e., paying for Workday while still on the current solution.  While we don?t see six months free granted too often this is a case where we?d suggest pushing for that i.e., 66 month term for same cost.  This is a two year project at least.  This is likely one of the first hospitals to be going all-in (HCM plus Financials) with Workday.  HIPAA concerns and capital intensive nature of hospitals have not been a great proving ground in the past for WD and SaaS.  They?re likely pushing for this to be a referenceable account. The comprehensiveness of this purchase should make the case that you need six months at no cost.  Adding term to the end is how WD addresses that. ?\tWD is increasing bundling their subscriptions making it difficult to benchmark without doing some reverse engineering.  CHOP should consider pushing for each subscription to have its own cost.  What if you want to grow (or keep) only 4 of the 6 bundled items in the third subscription? ?\tTo try and evaluate NPI viewed this as a five year term. That?s $2.4M a year for 5 years.  NPI also took the blended FSE average since there?s some growth forecast after month 15. ?\tThe FSE conversion table on p.3 is the typical table they use.  ?\tNPI then applied our typical analysis to see if using the FSE averages ( first table below) and our pricing expectations we could back into your $2.4M annual cost.  One key assumption we often make when trying to unbundle when there?s no line item aggregate pricing is that the Additional Subscription Fee table on P.1 reflects the same price for add-on FSEs as offered for the initial FSEs. This is generally a safe assumption. ?\tAt 13,000+ FSEs a price of $38.18 (again assuming this add?l FSE cost is the same as the original cost) is VERY strong for the core HCM subscription.  We?d generally expect that FSE level to land between $40-50 and maybe a bit higher if WD was feeling confident.  We would say this is toward the low end of our fair market value (FMV) range. ?\tWhen NPI evaluates Workday we first form an opinion on HCM and then all other modules are generally priced as a percentage of HCM.  o\tCCB and USP are combined.  We generally expect CCB to be at 25-30% of HCM and USP to be at 65-75% of HCM.  Using 25% and 75%, you?d then expect the combined bundle to equal the HCM cost.  It is close as HCM is $38.18 and CCB/USP is $40.61. This passes the sniff test but has some room for improvement.  o\tNPI would target HCM to stay flat; CCB at 25% and USP at 75%.  That would put CCB at $9.55 and USP at $28.64. This totals $38.18.  Achieving $38.18 drives $25-30K out of the annualized expense. o\tThe last part is a super SKU with 6 items bundled in.  Again, tough to reverse engineer.  The cost is 275% of the HCM SKU ($104.99 vs. $34.18). o\tNPI encourages CHOP to get this unbundled.  WD can be weird about it but will if pushed hard enough. o\tHistorically CCB was included with HCM. Here?s where there?s some art and science with a benchmark.  CCB is carved out largely to make HCM look smaller but historically something like FIN was priced at about 100% of HCM (when it included CCB).  That?s the approach NPI took with this review.  ?\tWe would expect FIN to be 100% of the combined HCM and CCB per FSE costs or $47.73 ($38.18 + $9.55) ?\tWe?ve never seen Grants before but newer subscriptions are generally at 25% of HCM to start ?\tWe?ve seen Projects bundled often with HCM ?\tWD has done a good job making it murkier to determine the right percentages ?\tUsing 100% for FIN and 25% for all the others (knowing a couple are likely a bit higher) and basing our expected costs as a percentage of HCM + CCB yields the second table below.  With more time NPI could likely vet these percentages of HCM further (but push WD to provide).   o\tOur calculation tallies $2.34M a year ($11.7M over the term).  This provides a nice sanity check that the $2.4M is in the ballpark of fair market value. It would be great to fine tune the percentages against line item pricing from WD.   o\tHopefully NPIs assumptions make sense. o\tThis is a lot to implement. CHOP should argue that without the deal of the century why should you prebuy all this stuff.  This is really comprehensive. o\tTarget 6 months free (i.e., 66 month term). o\tTarget $11.3 -11.5M as the annual cost but at this 5000 foot dive analysis $11.5-11.7M would be a solid landing spot. o\tExecute knowing $38.18 for HCM is stout at this FSE level.

The message to Chef should focus on dollar figures vs discount percentages.  It is a more convincing argument to explain to Chef that you are trying to reach a budgetary number of $82,250 (using a specific number makes it seem more realistic).  You may be able to rob from Peter to pay Paul and add some additional dollars to the budget for this project, but we are unlikely to get to $94K.  If Chef can meet us in the middle around $85K, approval will likely happen quicker.  NPI is interested in the negotiations that have occurred to this point with Chef?  What has VSP done & said to reach the current 65.7% blended discount?  In sum, NPI feels this pricing is within FMV as is, but 68% is achievable and would be closer to best-in-class.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI provided feedback via e-mail (see attached):  Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  Please see our feedback below:  ?\tChef Automate has a list price of $137/year per node, including some level of support (12x5). If you follow this link you?ll see that confirmed. https://www.chef.io/pricing/ ?\tIn 2015, Equifax bought 2,000 licenses of their prior subscription (Private Chef) which listed for $81 a year and received a 40% discount.  Somewhere over the past 2+ years you?ve upgraded to Chef Automate and got a slight uptick in your discount.  In 2015 we felt 50% was a stretch target and 45% was a good landing spot.  The outcome was 40%.  It helps to quickly review the background. ?\tThe core list price for what Equifax is buying is higher than the indicated quote list price because of the Premier Support upgrade which is ~20% of the $137.  The all-in list price is = $164 ($137 + $27).  NPIs gut feel is this is a bit of salesmanship as it appears Automate comes with 24x7 support (i.e., Premier).  NPI has a few suggestions related to this: o\tEquifax could consider asking Chef to provide a quote with Base/Standard Support. You can ask under the guise of trying to gauge if Premium is worth it. Even though they are ?including? Premium, there is a high probability these costs have been worked into overall pricing or more realistically are always included at no charge. Evaluating Base/Standard vs Premier will shake Chef up as vendors do not typically give anything away for free ? especially with a list price over $100K? o\tAll the support levels are via a web-based ticketing system.  Premium just puts you ahead in the queue and doesn?t get you a dedicated person or even a live person which supports the thinking that they include this at no charge. Chef is generally not the license that breaks your environment. If Chef is down the supporting applications won?t be down. The biggest difference across all three support levels is the handling of Sev 1 tickets. Base is a 12x5 two-hour response time, Standard is a 12x5 one-hour response time and Premium is a 24x7 30-minute response time.  o\tNPI found a few articles that seemed to state the $137 came with Premium Support. Just another reason to confirm and get further transparency. ?\thttps://reviews.financesonline.com/p/chef/ (excerpted below) ?\thttps://www.getapp.com/it-management-software/a/chef/pricing/     ?\tNPI used the list price of $137 per node and total node usage of 3,000 to 4,000 in the table below: o\tNPI believes all the subscriptions should be priced at the same level i.e., the original 2,000 subscriptions should be grandfathered into any discount improvement due to the expansion. o\tBased on existing discounts, our prior Equifax targets and other client outcomes, NPI has an FMV range of 40-50%.  We believe Equifax should target 50% for 4,000 subscriptions and 45% for 3,000 subscriptions.  Clearly, hitting +/- 5% on any of the scenarios is within FMV so the good news is you?re at a good point currently.   Equifax should be comfortable striving to achieve these targets based on Chef?s attempt to muddy the water with a $0 dollar line item on what NPI concludes is included plus this is certainly an industry with high margins that can flex on pricing to land some sizable growth.   Additionally, Chef will often be more willing to bump up their discount if customers agree to serve as a \"tier 1\" media reference if that is something Equifax would consider.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the rates from Accenture and found the overall blended rate of $159.65 to be in the range of FMV with room for improvement. While some of the individual rates are within FMV, other are at the high end of the range with room for improvement. In summary, NPI believes that there is potential for savings of about 5% of the total proposed cost of the project.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tTypical blended rates for the SFDC implementation (including offshore and onsite roles) vary between $150 per hour and $250 per hour based on the vendor and resource mix. Accenture?s blended rate is $159 per hour. ?\tSFDC?s stance in general is not to do implementations unless they have to.  They prefer to leave it to their partners.   o\tSFDC?s rates are typically in the $225-$250/hr range, so customers generally save money using service partners.   ?\tAdding to the conversation is the presence of India-based consultancies who often provide staff augmentation for some of the roles and leverage offshore resources.  NPI typically sees architect-level SFDC resources at rates around $120 - $150/hr from vendors like HCL, Infosys, and Cognizant. ?\tTypically, we see a phased approach where the Big 4/Accenture are involved in the initial assessment, strategy, change management, etc., and the ensuing implementation phases are bid out separately to other vendors, including mid-tier consulting firms and India-based consulting firms (who sometimes work in conjunction with the Big 4 on the implementation phases). ?\tNPI observed that 54% of the effort is offshore (in terms of the number of hours) and 46% is onsite. This is slightly higher than the typical range that NPI observes on SFDC implementation projects where 25% - 45% of the effort is offshore. This contributes to a lower blended rate. The high offshore utilization may be due to a larger offshore COE (Center of Excellence) for the SFDC practice. ?\tWhile the offshore rates seem extremely high (ranging between $35 and $105), NPI has observed that SFDC resource rates are much higher than the typical offshore rates that we see for other implementation and development projects (between $21 and $55). The same is true for onshore rates as well. ?\tNPI noted that there is a large difference between the hourly rates for the two change management content developer line items. Assuming one developer to be more senior, NPI has recommended a rate of $225 vs. $300 for the senior resource. At $185, the junior resource rate is FMV.\t ?\tThe tables below depict Accenture?s rates, NPI?s target rates and potential savings.",
        "customer_comments": "Pressed Rob but he held fast. Correct, the hourly figures did not change. Given that it was T&M and we needed to start quickly since we purchased software sooner than we thought, we just decided not to pursue.  It's possible that I may have to extend SOWs, so at that point I may reach out to you well in advance and push much harder related to the implementation resource cost.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the rates from Accenture and found the overall blended rate of $159.65 to be in the range of FMV with room for improvement. While some of the individual rates are within FMV, other are at the high end of the range with room for improvement. In summary, NPI believes that there is potential for savings of about 5% of the total proposed cost of the project.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tTypical blended rates for the SFDC implementation (including offshore and onsite roles) vary between $150 per hour and $250 per hour based on the vendor and resource mix. Accenture?s blended rate is $159 per hour. ?\tSFDC?s stance in general is not to do implementations unless they have to.  They prefer to leave it to their partners.   o\tSFDC?s rates are typically in the $225-$250/hr range, so customers generally save money using service partners.   ?\tAdding to the conversation is the presence of India-based consultancies who often provide staff augmentation for some of the roles and leverage offshore resources.  NPI typically sees architect-level SFDC resources at rates around $120 - $150/hr from vendors like HCL, Infosys, and Cognizant. ?\tTypically, we see a phased approach where the Big 4/Accenture are involved in the initial assessment, strategy, change management, etc., and the ensuing implementation phases are bid out separately to other vendors, including mid-tier consulting firms and India-based consulting firms (who sometimes work in conjunction with the Big 4 on the implementation phases). ?\tNPI observed that 54% of the effort is offshore (in terms of the number of hours) and 46% is onsite. This is slightly higher than the typical range that NPI observes on SFDC implementation projects where 25% - 45% of the effort is offshore. This contributes to a lower blended rate. The high offshore utilization may be due to a larger offshore COE (Center of Excellence) for the SFDC practice. ?\tWhile the offshore rates seem extremely high (ranging between $35 and $105), NPI has observed that SFDC resource rates are much higher than the typical offshore rates that we see for other implementation and development projects (between $21 and $55). The same is true for onshore rates as well. ?\tNPI noted that there is a large difference between the hourly rates for the two change management content developer line items. Assuming one developer to be more senior, NPI has recommended a rate of $225 vs. $300 for the senior resource. At $185, the junior resource rate is FMV.\t ?\tThe tables below depict Accenture?s rates, NPI?s target rates and potential savings.",
        "customer_comments": "Pressed Rob but he held fast. Correct, the hourly figures did not change. Given that it was T&M and we needed to start quickly since we purchased software sooner than we thought, we just decided not to pursue.  It's possible that I may have to extend SOWs, so at that point I may reach out to you well in advance and push much harder related to the implementation resource cost.",

        "current_narrative": "Matt and Jon, Here?s what I can tell you upon first blush. ?\tA five year term is kind of rare to see.  Typically is three years and have heard WD has balked at five years as that doesn?t allow for increases after the typical three year term.  That?s a plus. ?\tNPI interprets the 63 month term as that is WDs approach to handling the usual customer objection about doublepaying i.e., paying for Workday while still on the current solution.  While we don?t see six months free granted too often this is a case where we?d suggest pushing for that i.e., 66 month term for same cost.  This is a two year project at least.  This is likely one of the first hospitals to be going all-in (HCM plus Financials) with Workday.  HIPAA concerns and capital intensive nature of hospitals have not been a great proving ground in the past for WD and SaaS.  They?re likely pushing for this to be a referenceable account. The comprehensiveness of this purchase should make the case that you need six months at no cost.  Adding term to the end is how WD addresses that. ?\tWD is increasing bundling their subscriptions making it difficult to benchmark without doing some reverse engineering.  CHOP should consider pushing for each subscription to have its own cost.  What if you want to grow (or keep) only 4 of the 6 bundled items in the third subscription? ?\tTo try and evaluate NPI viewed this as a five year term. That?s $2.4M a year for 5 years.  NPI also took the blended FSE average since there?s some growth forecast after month 15. ?\tThe FSE conversion table on p.3 is the typical table they use.  ?\tNPI then applied our typical analysis to see if using the FSE averages ( first table below) and our pricing expectations we could back into your $2.4M annual cost.  One key assumption we often make when trying to unbundle when there?s no line item aggregate pricing is that the Additional Subscription Fee table on P.1 reflects the same price for add-on FSEs as offered for the initial FSEs. This is generally a safe assumption. ?\tAt 13,000+ FSEs a price of $38.18 (again assuming this add?l FSE cost is the same as the original cost) is VERY strong for the core HCM subscription.  We?d generally expect that FSE level to land between $40-50 and maybe a bit higher if WD was feeling confident.  We would say this is toward the low end of our fair market value (FMV) range. ?\tWhen NPI evaluates Workday we first form an opinion on HCM and then all other modules are generally priced as a percentage of HCM.  o\tCCB and USP are combined.  We generally expect CCB to be at 25-30% of HCM and USP to be at 65-75% of HCM.  Using 25% and 75%, you?d then expect the combined bundle to equal the HCM cost.  It is close as HCM is $38.18 and CCB/USP is $40.61. This passes the sniff test but has some room for improvement.  o\tNPI would target HCM to stay flat; CCB at 25% and USP at 75%.  That would put CCB at $9.55 and USP at $28.64. This totals $38.18.  Achieving $38.18 drives $25-30K out of the annualized expense. o\tThe last part is a super SKU with 6 items bundled in.  Again, tough to reverse engineer.  The cost is 275% of the HCM SKU ($104.99 vs. $34.18). o\tNPI encourages CHOP to get this unbundled.  WD can be weird about it but will if pushed hard enough. o\tHistorically CCB was included with HCM. Here?s where there?s some art and science with a benchmark.  CCB is carved out largely to make HCM look smaller but historically something like FIN was priced at about 100% of HCM (when it included CCB).  That?s the approach NPI took with this review.  ?\tWe would expect FIN to be 100% of the combined HCM and CCB per FSE costs or $47.73 ($38.18 + $9.55) ?\tWe?ve never seen Grants before but newer subscriptions are generally at 25% of HCM to start ?\tWe?ve seen Projects bundled often with HCM ?\tWD has done a good job making it murkier to determine the right percentages ?\tUsing 100% for FIN and 25% for all the others (knowing a couple are likely a bit higher) and basing our expected costs as a percentage of HCM + CCB yields the second table below.  With more time NPI could likely vet these percentages of HCM further (but push WD to provide).   o\tOur calculation tallies $2.34M a year ($11.7M over the term).  This provides a nice sanity check that the $2.4M is in the ballpark of fair market value. It would be great to fine tune the percentages against line item pricing from WD.   o\tHopefully NPIs assumptions make sense. o\tThis is a lot to implement. CHOP should argue that without the deal of the century why should you prebuy all this stuff.  This is really comprehensive. o\tTarget 6 months free (i.e., 66 month term). o\tTarget $11.3 -11.5M as the annual cost but at this 5000 foot dive analysis $11.5-11.7M would be a solid landing spot. o\tExecute knowing $38.18 for HCM is stout at this FSE level.

NPI has not seen a ton of services deals in the marketing automation area, even though we frequently benchmark marketing automation software.  We also have several SME?s in our Advisor Network who were able to provide some thoughts on your professional services pricing.  Massive Insights has offered a blended rate of $105 per hour. This is within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV). The market range for similar projects range widely between $90 and $150 per hour based on the actual resource mix.  While the offered $105 per hour is within the range of fair market value, there may be room for improvement of up to 14% on the cost of the SOW. A blended rate of $90 translates to savings of $121K for the SOW.  In terms of negotiating levers, Intuit is certainly in a position of strength.  Intuit is one of Massive Insight?s key vendors and Intuit?s name is displayed on their web page as a key client partner.  Intuit?s increasing spend with them also forms a strong lever.",

We have several deals in our database with this exact training SKU (2000761) so I can validate that the list price is $5K.  We have often seen this priced at $4000 - $4200 per class, which equates to a 16% - 20%.  Based on NPI?s knowledge of Springfield?s annual Citrix spend, we absolutely believe that 20% - 25% discounting is the correct target discount for this $20K list price quote.  The total for this training should fall between $15K - $17K.  The message to Citrix should start with a bit of frustration, ?Springfield clinic has been a good customer and we?ve continued to grow and expand our spend with Citrix.  A 5% discount on training, that is more of a benefit for Citrix than Springfield because it will allow us to continue to grow the solution (and spend more with Citrix), is very disappointing.  Unless the cost for this training can?t get to a more acceptable $3 - $4K per class, then we may need to back down to only 1 or 2 of these courses at this time.?",

(other tools are available in the ?open source? space). ?Threatmodeler was specifically identify by Gartner in their Hype Cycle for Application Security, 2017, for automating ?security requirements definition, risk assessment and threat modeling,? with SDLC integration, which ?can dynamically highlight potential security ramifications of functional requirements.? (NBC)  TM also recently hired the former Global Director of Fortify ( https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/12/globe-newswire-david-nester-joins-threatmodeler-software-as-chief-security-officer.html ). Combine that with a recent announcement of a partnership with Wipro to sell and deploy their solution and you get a sense for the trajectory that this company could be on.  NPI has only a couple of data points for them, and are honestly surprised to see that your offer for 200 threat models topped out at 40%. Our data would support an offer closer to the 50% that your rec?d for your unlimited proposal.  That being said, NPI expects that a proposal for only 50 or 100 threat models will be in the 30-40% discount range and Intuit will have to present a very complete case to push them higher than that.   Intuit could certainly offer the publicity angle as a way to leverage further discount, through reference calls or a case study if this proves successful for Intuit.   The bottom line is this, you don?t have to look that hard to find DevOps, SecOps or DevSec companies, but to find a company that puts it all together as TM claims with their ?automated? DevSecOps solution is pretty incredible, and TM knows it. TM still needs revenue to get their company off the ground and into the mainstream. Once Intuit determines how many threat models are truly required, the hard press will work with TM.",

        "description": "Hi Chris,  I need a price benchmark on the attached quotes from Threatmodeler.  This seems to be a pretty niche market, but the vendor is being super difficult and I want to make sure we get fair pricing.  Hopefully you guys can help us.  These are quotes they provided last year, we will be looking at quotes for 50 and 100 threats when they send them over.   Thanks!

In the interest of trying to get this back to you quickly, see our feedback below.  If you would like this in a more formal FMV report, I can put that together for you.  SAP SFSF ?\tOverall discount provided on the software is 91%. This is within the range of FMV, but we have seen on large deals of this size that SAP will reach 92%. Achieving a discount of 92% translates to savings of $311K per year on the software subscription. ?\tCost of Professional services is $2,998,900. NPI will need a bit more details around the specific resource rates to be able to benchmark this. SAP has a standard set of rates and list prices and NPI will be able to benchmark the associated discounts and share targets.  o\tIndividual rates vary from $245 to $400 per hour for onshore effort. Offshore rates vary between $55 and $75.  Blended rate for Success Factors implementation projects vary between $200 and $250 per hour based on resource mix, offshore utilization etc. ?\tThe travel cost associated with the services is estimated at 15% which is in the middle of the range of FMV. NPI has seen this vary between 10% and 25% based on project requirement. This is billed based on actuals.  Ceridian ?\tThe actual discount provided is not as well defined as in the SAP proposal. The cost per employee is $9.75 as compared to SAP?s proposed cost of $8.58 PEPM.  ?\tWhile the individual cost of the software is within FMV as compared to similar market transactions, NPI has seen that Ceridian is very cost competitive and will match SFSF?s pricing to win the business.  They will typically not lose a deal based on price. ?\tThe cost of implementation services is low as compared to SFSF at $860,600. Clearly, SAP and Ceridian?s effort estimate and approach to implementation is different. Once again, if Chico?s shares the details on these services (resource rates and effort), NPI will be able to benchmark the same.  o\tPS rates vary between $175 and $200 for onshore resources, although data conversion rates are lower and dashboard consulting rates are higher. ?\tEstimated Travel and Expense is 10% of implementation cost which is at the low end of the range of FMV.",

Unfortunately low, or zero, discounting is not uncommon for VMWare renewals.  Most VMWare renewals we review begin with 0% discounting.  VMWare renewals do not see very large discounts but 0% discounting, especially on a renewal of this size, is ABOVE FMV.    10% discounting on a VMWare renewal is about as high as we?ve seen.  We recommend targeting 10% - 12%, with an acceptable fallback to 6% - 8%.  Probably not the news you wanted to hear, but VMWare just doesn?t play ball very well on their renewals.  Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to discuss on a call.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI Reviewed the invoices and agreement amendment provided by Swedish Covenant and finds the PEPM (Per Employee Per Month) pricing of $11.81 to be within the range of FMV for an HCM solution. Solutions from competitive providers can often come in 2-3x this price.  The HCM solution from Ultimate is made of several components: Core, Talent Acquisition, Recruiting, Onboarding, Performance Management, and Compensation Management among others, all of which it appears SC is subscribing to.  SC committed in 2013 to a fee structure of $5.04 PEPM  NPI has not had another client pay for HCM services on a quarterly basis with monthly true-ups, the way that SC currently is, and would like to hear more about how that evolved?  NPI has not been provided any further change orders or amendments that reflect all of the other modules, nor do we have access to the original agreement, however, based on the invoices provided we were able to create the following data table of Quarterly and Annual pricing for each module and ultimately arrive at the aggregated PEPM number just under $12 PEPM.  Competitors in the space, such as Workday, SuccessFactors, Infor and others for sub 10K user environments will charge a far heavier PEPM than what SC is receiving, so making a competitive play will likely not bear any fruit for SC. Based on the original agreement(s) and agreed to pricing, if SCs pricing has crept up dramatically over the years, NPI could help SC structure a negotiation platform to perhaps reduce pricing to earlier levels, however, additional documentation would be required to support an effort such as that.",

While the main maintenance renewals hold strong discounting, there?s opportunity around the OCI licensing due to  alignment with NetApp?s quarter-end. NetApp has greater flexibility on the capital side of this purchase, but NPI recommends BNYM approach them with an even net target and let the vendor determine a way to relieve cost concerns. Offering this in exchange for an expedient signature before open deals begin drawing scrutiny and pressure across the sales organization as it gets later in April.  NPI hears many complaints about the high costs of NetApp?s OCI software, and it?s possible BNYM holds better precedent pricing from previous transactions.",

        "current_narrative": "Robert, Hey there.  Must be something about this space and how their vendors conceal their list prices.  I guess as security companies they are practicing what they preach ?.  While we?ve seen several Vormetric deals the SKUs often vary across our reviews and they don?t always show list pricing.  However, they do at times so we know they will provide it if asked.  Again, we got resourceful and tried to work through this and also leverage some public data.  I just got to a point where I think we are better off asking Trace3 to show add more transparency in their quote.  I think the SKUs are correct so that?s some good news.  The attached Excel file shows the work in progress.  I haven?t suggested targets yet since there?s too many open items.  Of note:  ?\tVOR-TE ? listed for $6K about 12 months ago.  Let?s confirm this.  You may also want to take this time and ask about the bundled list price (and even net) that includes the Transparent Encryption Agent, Application Encryption and Tokenization. Another client bought the bundle (at MUCH bigger volumes ? 1,500) but paid $1K for each bundle. Webster is at $3,150 for just TE. You?re at less than 2% of their volume but I?m curious what they?d offer and it may be good to know if that?s on your roadmap.  If only two of these are of interest I don?t think they have a bundle for that but you could ask.  This other client didn?t have the Tokenization Client license so perhaps they?re configuring their solution differently than Webster. o\tThe quantity of 25 for VOR-TE and VOR-VTE-LTD brings up another topic to push for clarity on. From the limited pricing I?ve seen there?s a clear example on their Data Encryption Agent license where the first one is $6K, ten cost $45K (or $4500 each) and 25 cost $100K or $4K each).  I think now is the time to make sure they show you what all these tiers look like to ensure you?re getting both the programmatic volume discount and the additional discount you?d get on a first-time competitive buy. ?\tVOR-VTE-LTD ? the one item I had no traction finding list pricing for ?\tVOR-TOKEN ? educated guess is this is also at $6K list ?\tThe DSM Enterprise Parts I believe have the same list and they just discount non-prod more than prod.  The list could be $30K or something north of $40K.  That reflects quite a swing in discounting so it is a key item to validate.  I?d be appreciative if you could also ask them for the list price of the physical DSM Enterprise equivalent. Perhaps you could say someone asked about that option and you wanted to understand it more.  I think it lists for at least $5K more. ?\tOn the Support side, Standard is always 18% of net and Premium is 22%.  We?ve never seen Premium+ which is what?s reflected on your quote.  Below is a picture of the comparison of these two in their SW Lic Agreement.  They?re offering the + at 23% of the total hardware and software net.  Doesn?t sound like a bad uplift over Premium assuming you?re getting something more.  Consider your options there.  ?\tSome services details are shown. o\tVormetric?s rack rate is $2,500/day. VOR-PRO-SERV is the SKU.  We?ve seen it not discounted typically.   o\tProgram Review and Roadmap Dev seems like it?ll be work done by Trace3 for a fixed fee of $51,800. They mention a Security Architect and PM. No hours are mentioned.   We?d expect this to reflect some hourly estimate applied against the rates and then a 10-20% uplift for the risk involved with a fixed fee engagement.  Maybe ask about a T&M to get exposure to the rates and effort. o\tProduct Install appears to be Vormetric people.  Offered at $12,500 that?s 5 days at their $2,500 rack rate.  That number of days doesn?t seem bloated.  In a competitive environment feels like that could be something to push for free. o\tTech Design and Impl - $67,500 for 6 weeks. That?s $11,250 a week or $2,250 a day if one resource which is exactly 10% off the Vormetric daily rack rate of $2500. It includes an Architect, Engineer and PM but again is offered at a fixed amount so no effort/hours noted.  Push for some clarity around this.  Is this Trace3 or Vormetric. On the one hand you?d expect a lower rate with Trace3 but oftentimes partners bring more senior resources to bear than the OEM/Publisher. o\tRoadmap and Mentoring is offered at $51,800 and is T&M. It is largely an architect at $300.  We can benchmark this.  Is this Trace3 or Vormetric.  We?ll work on what we can but let me know if you expect to reach out to Trace3 for this additional detail.  Now is the time and no reason to spend this money if there?s any questions about the transparency of the offer.  Also, do you expect future growth.  Getting transparency now sets you up for that.",
        "customer_comments": "Went with Vormetric.  Final quote increased in size largely due to Token Server Client item growing from 1 to 18.  The only reductions appear to be on the DSM units as both the Prod and non prod had reductions.  Maintenance also dropped from 23% to 20%.   The initial quotes didn't clear show all the non prod info that was shown in the final.  Estimating savings and new baseline but not overthinking it.  Future folks should use the final docs (also some list pricing in XLS) and new SME.",

Currently key management at Webster Bank is not a cohesive process but maintained by the individual systems that use keys.  Reply to first offer: We?ll take a look.  From my first pass I can tell you the Trace3 (Vormetric) SOW is too light on details.  There?s a lot ($530K+) of services with no resources, rates and hours so it can?t be benchmarked.  There?s also a sizable placeholder for hardware, licenses and support for $501K with no detail.  Trace3 needs to provide a Vormetric quote showing all the usual details (SKUs, list, net, quantities).  Webster came back on 3/13 with a revised spreadsheet showing list pricing.

        "current_narrative": "Founded in 2010, they are a fledgling company in the Security Risk Management Solution software space. They have a small, very dedicated team, with very little turnover, but are also very private about their company.  The only real competitor to Threatmodeler that shows up is TMT. (other tools are available in the ?open source? space). ?Threatmodeler was specifically identify by Gartner in their Hype Cycle for Application Security, 2017, for automating ?security requirements definition, risk assessment and threat modeling,? with SDLC integration, which ?can dynamically highlight potential security ramifications of functional requirements.? (NBC)  TM also recently hired the former Global Director of Fortify ( https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/12/globe-newswire-david-nester-joins-threatmodeler-software-as-chief-security-officer.html ). Combine that with a recent announcement of a partnership with Wipro to sell and deploy their solution and you get a sense for the trajectory that this company could be on.  NPI has only a couple of data points for them, and are honestly surprised to see that your offer for 200 threat models topped out at 40%. Our data would support an offer closer to the 50% that your rec?d for your unlimited proposal.  That being said, NPI expects that a proposal for only 50 or 100 threat models will be in the 30-40% discount range and Intuit will have to present a very complete case to push them higher than that.   Intuit could certainly offer the publicity angle as a way to leverage further discount, through reference calls or a case study if this proves successful for Intuit.   The bottom line is this, you don?t have to look that hard to find DevOps, SecOps or DevSec companies, but to find a company that puts it all together as TM claims with their ?automated? DevSecOps solution is pretty incredible, and TM knows it. TM still needs revenue to get their company off the ground and into the mainstream. Once Intuit determines how many threat models are truly required, the hard press will work with TM.",

        "current_narrative": "There?s a variety of info to report back.    For starters in the Draft Workbook worksheet ?Software Buyback-Destruct CTR? I added columns H-K to show the cost to upgrade the 3 items we discussed. I extended out the costs and applied a 65% discount. I also added in 3 years of SnS at 20% of the net license spend.  I included totals in row 20.  I had to estimate the vSOM upgrade but my figure is likely a little on the high side.  The two main upgrade SKUs are listed below.  I?m not exactly sure if you still want to calculate some sort of upgrade and renew SnS vs. do the ELA but this will be an input into that.  ?\tVS6-STD-EPL-UG-C - Upgrade: VMware vSphere 6 Standard to vSphere 6 Enterprise Plus for 1 Processor - $2,750  ?\tVS6-ENT-EPL-UG-C - Upgrade: VMware vSphere 6 Enterprise to vSphere 6 Enterprise Plus for 1 Processor - $682  The FMV range for the token-based discount is 65-75%.  I think the 64.28% is just below the FMV range.  I think getting well into the mid-70s will be a challenge but low 70s is a fair expectation given the size.  As discussed, push for 75% to allow the compromise to 72% or so.  A 2016 ELA that I reviewed (and believe was cancelled) had license discounts at 50% (NPI suggested 60% as a target) and that only had $2.2M in list license value.  This blows that away.  You also had SnS at 19% of the net license spend so that would be our target here (vs. 20% offer).  Remind me to chat with you about the topic of handling SnS costs when you cash in tokens which must be used for both the license AND the prorated SnS.  The three-year list price for Mission Critical Support is $1,320,000 or $440K a year. The Global one year SKU is MCS-GLOBAL-SUP-C with a list of $500K.  The three-year SKU is MCS-GLOBAL-3SUP-C which has a programmatic 12% list price reduction to $440K.  The SKU clearly states to get this you need to be paying for Production SnS and a TAM to qualify for MCS.  Interestingly, their price list describes the product as ?VMware Mission Critical Support - Global Option - non-ELA, 3 Year?.  The key words are non-ELA. When I see this I think ?what?s the price if I have an ELA??.  I checked an old price list and the non-ELA used to be A LOT more.  I think they just haven?t fixed the description yet.  A 10% discount should be expected.  The show this already at a 12% discount but that is overstated.  It is a programmatic reduction in their list price and not a concession on this deal.  Additionally, I saw one client doing a sizable ELA that focused largely on vCloud Suite (upgrades and new).  As part of their deal they got their Production Support upgraded to Mission Critical for two years at no charge so we know that type of creativity is possible. They also got one full time Tier 3 TAM (list is $300K) at no charge and paid for one as well.  The TAM being offered (actually it isn?t the offer but it is a list price shown on the last worksheet) indicates the SKU is TAM-TIER-2.  Typically I see this have a list of $154,995 but it can have multiple personalities as evidenced by the description NPI has seen as follows:  1. A single (1) TAM SKU includes 1 business days worth of time each week delivered by a VMware TAM for a duration of one year.   2. A single (1) STAM SKU includes a half-week (2.5 business days) of a single TAM resource delivered for one year. 3. A single (1) Dedicated STAM SKU includes a week (5 business days) delivered by a single TAM resource for one year.  Note, only full SKUs may be ordered no partial amounts, half-SKUs, or changes to the published fees on the order will be honored without prior sign-off from the VP of PSO for the geography.   Multiple quantities of the TAM SKUs may be included on an order.  See the TAM FAQ for more information (TAM.VMware.COM)  The $154,995 applies to the one-day a week item.  MetLife is getting ?Enterprise Technical Account Manager - 2.5 days/week? so it does make intuitive sense that your list price is about 33% higher at $206K.  That passes our sniff test.  Actually, that?s the list price shown but in the one-page ELA summary there?s a Tier-1 TAM noted with a list of $87,445.  This must be Global.  NPI has seen list of $64,955 about 24 months ago.  A year ago we saw the non-Global at $71,495 and MetLIfe in 2016 had a Global TAM one-year offer of $76,995 (reflecting the Global upcharge).  The current $87,445 reflects an almost 14% increase from the $76,995.  That?s sizable.  I?d point that out and push for 10-20% discounting.   The Education and PSO credits are priced exactly as you?d expect. At volumes over 1,200 the programmatic list price drops from $100 to $80.  Not a real concession in my mind. The BS about all these credits being required to justify the discounts is pure salesmanship.  No discounts on TAM or MCS and the token discount is pedestrian at this spend level.  Credits often expire in a year, if you buy push to ensure they can be used throughout the three year term.  I reflected targets in columns I and J in the attached one page ELA summary.  NPI has not seen a lot of MCS purchased. I found 4 attached PDFs that talk about the differences between MCS and BCS.   FINAL FEEDBACK: Hey Jim, Hope the week is going well.  We went back and continued to think on your VMWare situation.  It definitely has a few wrinkles: ?\tNot really net new license spend although it can seemingly look like it is ?\tChallenged with the knowledge that there?s already a contractual obligation of $10.8M in installed base SnS over the next four years (three year $8.1M obligation extended to four years) ?\tReflects a 12% reduction from the $10.8M and includes lots of upgrades needed for the COE and creates an SnS run rate reduction of about $1.6M a year ($2.7M to an NPI estimated $1.1M)  ?\tCould include upside of using functionality included in upgrade to replace Turbonomics spend  So in light of these wrinkles and the tokens not being net new I do think it makes sense to reconsider FMV and BIC targets.  The last offer was a 66% discount. This improved and entered into NPIs initial FMV range of 65 to 75% where we indicated exceeding 72% would be very challenging.  Many clients with smaller spend struggle to hit NPIs 50% discount target.   After revisiting past reviews and figuring out how to reflect the unique situation (noted above), NPI revised FMV range and BIC discount are: ?\t62-68% is our best estimate of an FMV range.  ?\tAbove 68% for this situation feels equivalent to a BIC discount",
        "customer_comments": "we went back and forth.  This got pretty focused on the token discount.  He also was concerned that the token buy really wasn't net new so we may not want to hold it to the typical new license buy discount standard. Also made a strong case that VMware knew they had locked rev from IB SNS and so why do an ELA for less than that.  FInal baseline required adjustments as tokens changed and relief on past support changed.  Also took a bit of a leap of faith that discount should be considered higher due to relief issue even though the figure shown was a list price which isn't reality.",

        "description": "Weird situation.  Many vsphere licenses are on extended support.  Lots of upgrades needed plus VMware doesn't sell standard and enterprise editions anymore.  VMWare clearly getting creative to recognize software revenue.  They're offering to buy back a bunch of software and then Metlife to buy tokens to buy the upgraded software.  Really just need vsphere E+ but we think for rev rec reasons they're saying they need vSOM (vsphere operations mgt).  Really odd. Offered to buy at 80% of list. Now at 95%.  Weird since they bought at a discount.  Saw once before with ADP-CDK where the buyback quantity was WAY more than the licenses owned.  It's clear financial engineering of some sort.  Lots of tokens included to buy VSOM.  We did an exercise to see the cost if they just upgraded a bunch of licenses. Many licenses are already e+ and are fine.  They included a bunch of services as well.  It wasn't a typical analysis since the buyback and the spreadsheet are quite odd.  Turns out to support a center of excellence (COE) they need to get on same versions so the threat of doing a few upgrades only weakened.  Jim asked for some set things and we acted as a sounding board.",

Actually, that?s the list price shown but in the one-page ELA summary there?s a Tier-1 TAM noted with a list of $87,445.  This must be Global.  NPI has seen list of $64,955 about 24 months ago.  A year ago we saw the non-Global at $71,495 and MetLIfe in 2016 had a Global TAM one-year offer of $76,995 (reflecting the Global upcharge).  The current $87,445 reflects an almost 14% increase from the $76,995.  That?s sizable.  I?d point that out and push for 10-20% discounting.   The Education and PSO credits are priced exactly as you?d expect. At volumes over 1,200 the programmatic list price drops from $100 to $80.  Not a real concession in my mind. The BS about all these credits being required to justify the discounts is pure salesmanship.  No discounts on TAM or MCS and the token discount is pedestrian at this spend level.  Credits often expire in a year, if you buy push to ensure they can be used throughout the three year term.  I reflected targets in columns I and J in the attached one page ELA summary.  NPI has not seen a lot of MCS purchased. I found 4 attached PDFs that talk about the differences between MCS and BCS.   FINAL FEEDBACK: Hey Jim, Hope the week is going well.  We went back and continued to think on your VMWare situation.  It definitely has a few wrinkles: ?\tNot really net new license spend although it can seemingly look like it is ?\tChallenged with the knowledge that there?s already a contractual obligation of $10.8M in installed base SnS over the next four years (three year $8.1M obligation extended to four years) ?\tReflects a 12% reduction from the $10.8M and includes lots of upgrades needed for the COE and creates an SnS run rate reduction of about $1.6M a year ($2.7M to an NPI estimated $1.1M)  ?\tCould include upside of using functionality included in upgrade to replace Turbonomics spend  So in light of these wrinkles and the tokens not being net new I do think it makes sense to reconsider FMV and BIC targets.  The last offer was a 66% discount. This improved and entered into NPIs initial FMV range of 65 to 75% where we indicated exceeding 72% would be very challenging.  Many clients with smaller spend struggle to hit NPIs 50% discount target.   After revisiting past reviews and figuring out how to reflect the unique situation (noted above), NPI revised FMV range and BIC discount are: ?\t62-68% is our best estimate of an FMV range.  ?\tAbove 68% for this situation feels equivalent to a BIC discount",

        "current_narrative": "There?s a variety of info to report back.    For starters in the Draft Workbook worksheet ?Software Buyback-Destruct CTR? I added columns H-K to show the cost to upgrade the 3 items we discussed. I extended out the costs and applied a 65% discount. I also added in 3 years of SnS at 20% of the net license spend.  I included totals in row 20.  I had to estimate the vSOM upgrade but my figure is likely a little on the high side.  The two main upgrade SKUs are listed below.  I?m not exactly sure if you still want to calculate some sort of upgrade and renew SnS vs. do the ELA but this will be an input into that.  ?\tVS6-STD-EPL-UG-C - Upgrade: VMware vSphere 6 Standard to vSphere 6 Enterprise Plus for 1 Processor - $2,750  ?\tVS6-ENT-EPL-UG-C - Upgrade: VMware vSphere 6 Enterprise to vSphere 6 Enterprise Plus for 1 Processor - $682  The FMV range for the token-based discount is 65-75%.  I think the 64.28% is just below the FMV range.  I think getting well into the mid-70s will be a challenge but low 70s is a fair expectation given the size.  As discussed, push for 75% to allow the compromise to 72% or so.  A 2016 ELA that I reviewed (and believe was cancelled) had license discounts at 50% (NPI suggested 60% as a target) and that only had $2.2M in list license value.  This blows that away.  You also had SnS at 19% of the net license spend so that would be our target here (vs. 20% offer).  Remind me to chat with you about the topic of handling SnS costs when you cash in tokens which must be used for both the license AND the prorated SnS.  The three-year list price for Mission Critical Support is $1,320,000 or $440K a year. The Global one year SKU is MCS-GLOBAL-SUP-C with a list of $500K.  The three-year SKU is MCS-GLOBAL-3SUP-C which has a programmatic 12% list price reduction to $440K.  The SKU clearly states to get this you need to be paying for Production SnS and a TAM to qualify for MCS.  Interestingly, their price list describes the product as ?VMware Mission Critical Support - Global Option - non-ELA, 3 Year?.  The key words are non-ELA. When I see this I think ?what?s the price if I have an ELA??.  I checked an old price list and the non-ELA used to be A LOT more.  I think they just haven?t fixed the description yet.  A 10% discount should be expected.  The show this already at a 12% discount but that is overstated.  It is a programmatic reduction in their list price and not a concession on this deal.  Additionally, I saw one client doing a sizable ELA that focused largely on vCloud Suite (upgrades and new).  As part of their deal they got their Production Support upgraded to Mission Critical for two years at no charge so we know that type of creativity is possible. They also got one full time Tier 3 TAM (list is $300K) at no charge and paid for one as well.  The TAM being offered (actually it isn?t the offer but it is a list price shown on the last worksheet) indicates the SKU is TAM-TIER-2.  Typically I see this have a list of $154,995 but it can have multiple personalities as evidenced by the description NPI has seen as follows:  1. A single (1) TAM SKU includes 1 business days worth of time each week delivered by a VMware TAM for a duration of one year.   2. A single (1) STAM SKU includes a half-week (2.5 business days) of a single TAM resource delivered for one year. 3. A single (1) Dedicated STAM SKU includes a week (5 business days) delivered by a single TAM resource for one year.  Note, only full SKUs may be ordered no partial amounts, half-SKUs, or changes to the published fees on the order will be honored without prior sign-off from the VP of PSO for the geography.   Multiple quantities of the TAM SKUs may be included on an order.  See the TAM FAQ for more information (TAM.VMware.COM)  The $154,995 applies to the one-day a week item.  MetLife is getting ?Enterprise Technical Account Manager - 2.5 days/week? so it does make intuitive sense that your list price is about 33% higher at $206K.  That passes our sniff test.  Actually, that?s the list price shown but in the one-page ELA summary there?s a Tier-1 TAM noted with a list of $87,445.  This must be Global.  NPI has seen list of $64,955 about 24 months ago.

With a current blended discount of 65.7%, VSP is within FMV, but we have seen slightly better discounting and we believe VSP should target 68% for 2,000 Nodes, returning an additional ~$6K in savings.   The message to Chef should focus on dollar figures vs discount percentages.  It is a more convincing argument to explain to Chef that you are trying to reach a budgetary number of $82,250 (using a specific number makes it seem more realistic).  You may be able to rob from Peter to pay Paul and add some additional dollars to the budget for this project, but we are unlikely to get to $94K.  If Chef can meet us in the middle around $85K, approval will likely happen quicker.  NPI is interested in the negotiations that have occurred to this point with Chef?  What has VSP done & said to reach the current 65.7% blended discount?  In sum, NPI feels this pricing is within FMV as is, but 68% is achievable and would be closer to best-in-class.",

        "current_narrative": "We reviewed Mavenlink and Workfront together... VSP went with Workfront - achieves small savings there.    NPI provided feedback via email, see attached.  Not a lot of previous exposure to Mavenlink as it appears more costly than Workfront. Suggested targeting lower cost license (premier) to see $20K reduction in quoted license (enterprise) pricing or even choosing the lower cost item.  NPI recommends that VSP approach Mavenlink with dollar figures instead of discount percentages.  The message to Mavenlink could be something along these lines, ?We had an expectation ? and set our budget accordingly ? that we would see a charge more like $30/user/month, or $360/year.  The current offer of $60/user/month is really a non-starter.  This is a competitive bid situation and for the most part, the remaining solutions are technically similar.  So it has come down to a pricing conversation, and Mavenlink is losing ? badly.  We may be able to rob Peter to pay Paul and move some additional money into the budget for this project, but we won?t be able to get near $72K.?  Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like to discuss further on a call.",
        "customer_comments": "After our conversation yesterday re: Workfront & Mavenlink, I wanted to follow-up with the feedback on Mavenlink (Workfront feedback sent in different email).  We?ve discussed everything below, but wanted to get it to you in written form so you have it.  Originally, NPI reviewed a 36-month term for Mavenlink Enterprise for 200 users.  In our discussion yesterday, we see that Mavenlink is now offering a 24% discount for 100 users, for a total license cost of $72K.  While NPI has seen fewer Mavenlink deals than we have seen for Workfront, we have enough data points to provide some general market analysis.  NPI believes the target discount for this size deal is closer to 30% - 35% discounting which would result in a total annual license cost of ~$60K.  Regarding the professional services, these are offered with 0% discounting.  It is not unusual that professional services have no discount, but on a deal of this size and term length, it is also reasonable to seek a nominal 5% - 15% discount on these services.  See the table below for an illustration of NPI?s recommended targets:",

While the main maintenance renewals hold strong discounting, there?s opportunity around the OCI licensing due to  alignment with NetApp?s quarter-end. NetApp has greater flexibility on the capital side of this purchase, but NPI recommends BNYM approach them with an even net target and let the vendor determine a way to relieve cost concerns. Offering this in exchange for an expedient signature before open deals begin drawing scrutiny and pressure across the sales organization as it gets later in April.  NPI hears many complaints about the high costs of NetApp?s OCI software, and it?s possible BNYM holds better precedent pricing from previous transactions.",
        "customer_comments": "Targets ?\tNPI recommends offering a $2.4M net total as the focal point NetApp needs to hit to maintain momentum that could lead to a signature before April.   o\tNPI recognizes that this transaction is needed and BNYM is under some extra timing pressure due to expired agreements in this deal, but NetApp commonly faces cost concerns with OCI?s rising outlays in environments. The sales team will be wary of any sign that the deal or any of its components could be put on hold to fit BNYM?s own internal cost goals.    ?\tNPI highly recommends not addressing specific discount amounts and approaching NetApp with the bottom-line figure. BNYM can address specific discounting around the OCI License True-up or other parts if better precedent discounting exists, but NetApp will not be responsive to anything tied to benchmarks or requests for better raw discounting. o\tSimilarly, the StorageX spend would best be approached with a $250k net target if this is a net new investment. Without that confirmation, NPI cannot recommend a more aggressive target.    ?\tThe range of FMV includes discounts more aggressive than the 72% on the OCI software, but NPI?s target remains conservative due to prevailing factors driving the transaction.  If some other leverage exists, for example another upcoming capital spend or a recent lapse in SLAs, NPI would target discounts in the higher 70s for the OCI capacity.",

        "current_narrative": "REI requested feedback on a Parasoft Pilot Program totalling $71K  No comparable data within SFDC, provided general feedback as the pricing should be great given that it is a pilot/test trial.   NPI provided feedback via email, see attached.",
        "customer_comments": "We were hoping to get a positive hit on the product SKUs but could not find any matches.  We have typically seen the perpetual licenses at a much higher cost than that of your subscription pricing.  Parasoft may have also created a custom SKU/product for REI that is not in the usual product catalog offered to all customers ? especially since this reflects a 9 month pilot with option to credit toward unlimited ELA solutions prior to 12/31/2018.   As NPI will do for niche vendors that we do not have frequent exposure to, we will look toward LinkedIn to identify potential SMEs to gain company insight. Without having much luck in the process, we did note flat/declining LinkedIn hiring activity over the last year which likely means Parasoft is hungry for new business and logos on their website. This would support low initial pricing in hopes to lure REI onto the platform.   NPI suggests gaining further clarity of the ?REI may choose to leverage the already incurred costs of the Pilot as credit?? (found at the bottom of the first quote you provided) to confirm full understanding of what the 2nd year total costs would be should REI decide to retain Parasoft. Identifying this early in the process protects REI from overexposing to unforeseen ?sticker shock? and can play part in ultimately determining whether it is worth embarking on the pilot program. This will also provide additional detail of ?how good a deal? the pilot is and how you may be able to leverage that information to lock in pricing.   As for ?Consulting Services?, NPI see the current fees as their typical rack rate and would target 8% - 10% in discounting. Achieving these savings results in an additional $2,400 - $3,000 in savings.",

The proposal include a total of 96 hours of professional services.  56 would be to setup the pilot and 40 would be used for training.  Combined the hourly rate is $312 which seems high but don?t know if that is common for this type of engagement.  The $41,000 is a one year license.

Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  We?ve seen a number of Unicom purchases and renewals so I do have data to compare, but I may need additional information.  Unicom maintenance for these 2 products is typically 18% of net license cost, and depending on the size, we have seen that get down as low as 15% of net license cost.  This renewal quote doesn?t provide quite enough detail to figure out the pricing on this.  Ideally, you would go back to the original purchase and insure that your maintenance costs are still in the 15% - 20% of net license cost.   If you don?t know original costs, then you could try to back in to it using specific products and # of MIPS.    The 2 graphics below shows list price for specific products based on # of MIPs.  Again, this is the list price for the license, maintenance would be 18% of the net license fee.  There are several pages within the price list that NPI has for each of these products for ?Assembler support?, ?Batch Support?, ?CICS support?, ?DB2 Support?, etc.  Let me know if you can find your original purchase for these licenses or if you can provide the additional details for us to back in to the license costs so that we can calculate the maintenance fees.",

        "current_narrative": "This is a service subject to tariff regulations and there is always some vagueness around when a carrier can discount and how they discount.  The most recent tariff covering this service is attached.  The pricing covering this service begins at the bottom of page 130.  From that pricing, NPI determined that Progressive is getting a 17% discount on nodes and a 45% discount on channel mileage (see below).  Tariff Element\tTariff Rate\tContract Rate\tSavings  Node\t$3690\t$3050\t$640 or 17% Mileage (per mile)\t$150\t$82.50\t$67.50 or 45%   The total is $10,800 per month, $129,600 per year or $259,200 over the term.  Incremental discounts may be available to Progressive depending on the overall spend with Centurylink.  If the service has already been installed for 60 months or more, Progressive may push for a 25% discount on the Node.  Doing so would save $10,170  per year ($20,340/term).  The messaging around this is simply that you are being asked to scrutinize every expense.  You are simply asking if they can find any way to apply a 25% discount to the cost of nodes.  Progressive can realize a more significant savings with either a technology migration or migration to alternative suppliers.  Most of NPI's clients have migrated away from these types of rings in favor of redundant point-to-point diverse fiber connections.

        "current_narrative": "Fred, Hey there. So we see Hortonworks a couple times a year.  Most are HDP but certainly some HDF.  We?ve seen the same discounting approach for both.  Generally quite stingy. NPI was only able to focus on the Term offer.  I?ve got a SME who resells for IBM and is able to validate list pricing.  Even though MetLife is an SVP Level J IBM customer that isn?t impacting your Hortonworks (HW) pricing at all.  Generally, the base price for an IBM license is level BL (Baseline). I think of that as the absolute highest list price.  Depending on your spend you earn an SVP level with IBM.  Most clients are H, I or J.  For many IBM items Level I introduces a revised MSRP that is 15% lower than BL.  Level J is generally about 20% lower.  There are some products where there?s no difference i.e., BL = SVP H = SVP J.  On our own, we also validated these are list prices by comparing to a few other client reviews.  With the HW products I wasn?t surprised to learn there?s no programmatical reduction in the list price even if you?re SVP J.  Here?s an insider?s view below of the first two products in your quote from IBM.  You can see BL = each SVP price.  For many Level J clients we?d expect some sizable discounts off of that price (50%+); however, it appears (and it is not surprising) that MetLIfe is being offered only a 20% discount.  I would?ve guessed IBM would be constrained by the same pricing approach HW offers themselves.  Do you know your current discounts on your HDP support subscriptions?  If it works to your favor I?d be leveraging that.  So MetLife is being offered a 20% discount of list. Again, there?s no inherent pricing advantage being a Level J IBM Customer so don?t let them tell you otherwise.  NPIs FMV range on a one-year HW subscription with an extended list price of $554,000 is 28-35%.  The offer feels a bit on the low side for an initial purchase and such a sizable expansion beyond HDP into HDF.  Exceeding 40% would be considered best-in-class.  In the past, clients have been told multi-year deals (the example was 3 years) received 6% more i.e., a one year offer at 20% became three years each at 26%.  NPI is not sure if IBM can offer this or if MetLife is interested in this term.  We?ve also seen clients stagger their growth and receive increases in their discounting (2-4 points) as they bump up their volume each year.  In sum, the offer feels a bit light.  A 30% outcome would lower the current $443K offer to $388K for a $55K reduction.  A 40% outcome drops the net to $360K or an $83K reduction.  Reviewed revised; Thanks. Everything in terms of term, products and quantities remains unchanged.  Discount went from 20 to 25%.  Definitely right up against FMV in my estimation. They are getting increasingly stingy and you are seeing that.  Plus there?s the added twist of IBM being involved and taking their cut which certainly has to impact your end discount.  30% would still be the target.  Open to a longer term?  I know there?s not much in terms of competition for the Flow/Streaming products so that makes it tougher.  Glad to see the improvement for sure.",

Pricing Analysis ?\tMetLife?s software discount is in line with historic pricing for MetLife at a 60% discount off List.  ?\tNPI added a new layer of analysis and also benchmarked this SKU against a competitive product and provides some additional negotiating points below.

We are providing this information to add some additional insight and potential negotiating points in the discussion on pricing with Cisco.  Denodo has multiple Licensing Models based on Customer requirements. Their claim is to attempt to offer the Licensing Model which best fits the customer?s need. Denodo licenses the Platform according to the number of cores, with all features included out of the box (Connectors, etc?). The amount of processing cores required is dependent on the Use Cases and the complexities of the queries, transformations, number of concurrent queries, etc.   Denodo offers the product in three different modalities:  ?\tPerpetual Single Server  ?\tPerpetual Multi server  ?\tAnnual Subscription   Perpetual Multi-Server  ?\tPricing is typically sold at ~$100,000 per Prod Core with Unlimited Non-Prod (see notes) with full flexibility to configure cores in multiple servers as needed.   o\tCisco pricing is offered at $298,500 for 4 Prod and 1 Non-Prod Cores with additional charges for staging/backup servers. o\tDepending on the system landscape, scenarios with a large Non-Prod (Dev/Test/Stage) environment may require additional spend for additional non-prod licenses under the Cisco offer, where an unlimited scenario under a Denodo model would include these licenses for no cost.  (For Example.  4 Prod cores with 4 Dev cores under the Cisco model would require MetLife to purchase 3 additional Non-Prod cores as the SKU only included 4 Prod and 1 Non-Prod core.  The Denodo model would allow 4 Prod cores AND up to the same number of Non-Prod cores (which would be 4).  ?\tAll Non-Production licenses are included at No Charge so long as the quantity of cores deployed in any one non-Production server does not exceed the quantity of cores deployed in the Production server., i.e., 8 Production Cores are purchased, customer can deploy as many non-production servers so long as no one non-production server exceeds 8 cores so this is a standard offer from Denodo.   Perpetual support pricing - Annual Support and Maintenance for Perpetual Licenses  ?\tStandard Support - 20% Of Net Price  ?\tPremium Support - 25% Of Net Price o\tCisco pricing is offered at 31% (5 Year), 34% (3 Year), or 36% (1 Year) of Net Price  Single Server Subscription  ?\tAnnual subscriptions start at $10k/month/per Quad Core Server, including annual support and maintenance (5 day x 8 hr.), $11k month/Quad Core Server, including annual support and maintenance (7 day x 24 hr.).  ?\tNon-Production Servers are not included and would be priced using the same ratio as in the Single Server Model. A minimum commitment of one year is required. Customers with budget constraints might chose the subscription model. The subscription model is less cost effective in the long term than the perpetual model.  ?\tOne quad core at Premium Support for the production environment is 12 months  x $11K = $132K   ?\tNPI finds that Cisco pricing is within FMV yet if a convincing argument can be made on competitive product lines, favorable support options may be able to be negotiated into today?s contract to ensure support costs remain favorable to MetLife.   ?\tNPI recommends that MetLife ask if a more favorable Dev/Test/Stage licensing model can be crafted to avoid future increases tied to this area.  (Point to the unlimited offer of the competitor). ?\tOverall, the offer, as it currently stands, is within a reasonable FMV range and MetLife can proceed with confidence as the negotiated target discounts are small figures that may not justify further negotiations.",

If you need this in a more formal document, I can put that together for you, just let me know.  The majority of the HW on the quote is discounted at 23.0%.  NPI considers this to be within the range of Fair Market Value (FMV), but we have seen that, on a purchase of this size, Oracle will reach 25% - 26%.  At 25% discounting, this proposal would total ~$160K per site, a savings of ~$5K per site.  Support is priced at exactly 12.0% of the net HW cost, this is very standard for Oracle and they will not move off of that number.  However, if JCI is successful in reducing the HW cost, you will want to make sure that support remains at 12% of the new cost.

While price points are competitive (the main ASO piece?s rates are below FMV), the total deal?s actual value will vary depending on true utilization during the term.  Timing pressure is elevated for both sides, but depending on the sales team?s eagerness, this deal could be key to quotas.  BNYM has also indicated that the RAT components would be nice to add under the ULA, but may not be a necessarily part of this.  Adding these products to the ULA also adds the risks associated with variable deployment schedules.  Positioning these doubts as the reason BNYM is holding off on a purchase decision could edge out some final savings in the final hours. However, NPI considers this pricing to be strong as is.",

Starting with that figure without commentary will have the greatest effect, and if pressed, BNYM can then offer explanation behind the rationale.  As credibly as is possible, this target figure should be linked to budgetary concerns.   ?\tNPI highly recommends tying this to a simple budgetary goal needed for the quickest approval, and not mentioning any specific discounting or benchmarks.",

NPI has seen SAP?s HEC services and we had a number of deals of similar size and scope for comparison.  NPI reviewed the proposed cost of HANA Enterprise Cloud for Projects and Enhanced Managed Services and found the proposal to be largely at Fair Market Value (FMV).  SAP?s HANA Enterprise Cloud is essentially an Infrastructure-as-a-Service managed services for SAP software where the customer can offload the management of their SAP footprint.  As with the large accompanying license purchase that NPI previously reviewed, the pricing for HEC is fairly custom and based on the SAP footprint. Since this purchase is being made on the heels of the large SAP purchase where Stericycle obtained very high discounts approaching best-in-class, not surprisingly, the pricing on this cloud services deal is also at the low (better) end of the range of FMV.  The SLAs and other terms and conditions are fairly standard and in line with the Ts and Cs that NPI has observed with comparable transactions. SAP Hana Enterprise Cloud is typically sold in two flavors, Projects and Production. The SLA for Projects is 95% as proposed in the order form and the SLA for Production is 99.5% (Stericycle is not purchasing this).   The pricing for HEC for projects is a consumption?based, weekly service fee. In this case it is priced at $20,556 per week. Based on Stericycle?s SAP footprint and sizing, this translates to an annual cost of a little over a $1M a year which is at FMV. NPI would expect this price to be between $1M and $1.2M based on comparisons to similarly sized deals.  EMS services are priced at $147 per hour which is also within Fair Market Value.",

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for sending this over and thanks again, for your patience in getting this feedback.  NPI has seen SAP?s HEC services and we had a number of deals of similar size and scope for comparison.  NPI reviewed the proposed cost of HANA Enterprise Cloud for Projects and Enhanced Managed Services and found the proposal to be largely at Fair Market Value (FMV).  SAP?s HANA Enterprise Cloud is essentially an Infrastructure-as-a-Service managed services for SAP software where the customer can offload the management of their SAP footprint.  As with the large accompanying license purchase that NPI previously reviewed, the pricing for HEC is fairly custom and based on the SAP footprint. Since this purchase is being made on the heels of the large SAP purchase where Stericycle obtained very high discounts approaching best-in-class, not surprisingly, the pricing on this cloud services deal is also at the low (better) end of the range of FMV.  The SLAs and other terms and conditions are fairly standard and in line with the Ts and Cs that NPI has observed with comparable transactions. SAP Hana Enterprise Cloud is typically sold in two flavors, Projects and Production. The SLA for Projects is 95% as proposed in the order form and the SLA for Production is 99.5% (Stericycle is not purchasing this).   The pricing for HEC for projects is a consumption?based, weekly service fee. In this case it is priced at $20,556 per week. Based on Stericycle?s SAP footprint and sizing, this translates to an annual cost of a little over a $1M a year which is at FMV. NPI would expect this price to be between $1M and $1.2M based on comparisons to similarly sized deals.  EMS services are priced at $147 per hour which is also within Fair Market Value.",

Compared to the prior year blended discount of ~40%, there is an obvious discount erosion even with the higher dollar spend.  Last year, the one-year term NPI reviewed had a blended 38.4% discount that rose to 43.4% in the final version.

        "current_narrative": "Hi Lorna,  Thanks for sending this over.  There isn?t quite enough detail to completely benchmark this pricing, but I have sent it over to NPI?s OutSystems SME to see if they can help decipher it.    This appears to be for professional services and they have outlined some of the hours that they expect for each role, but there is a 4-month window that just says ?weekly support? for a Customer Service Engineer and an Engagement Manager.  Using the time estimates they HAVE provided, I am able to account for about ~$115K: ? 144 hours ? Engagement Mangaer ? Estimating $250/hr = $36K ? 200 hours ? Technical Lead ? Estimating $220/hr = $44K ? 160 hours ? Developer ? Estimating $180/hr = $28800 ? 32 hours ? Customer Service Engineer ? Estimating $200/hr = $6,400  So it will depend on how many hours are expected in ?Weekly Support? from the EM and CSE as to whether that will make up the additional $25K.  NPI recommends that Stericycle ask for a bit more detail behind these costs.  Since this is professional services, it is acceptable (and expected) that you should know the hourly rates and estimated # of hours for each role.  A common response to a request like this is that OutSystems will say, ?it could be 2 or it could be 5, we don?t know.?  Be assured that they have put together estimates on the level of effort in order to create this pricing.  Stericycle will want to know the estimated work effort  because that will determine if this pricing is fair or not.  If the EM and CSE will average 2-hours per week during that 4-month period, then the total cost comes to about $130K and Stericycle should seek a reduction.  If they will average 4+ hours per week, then this cost will be approximately break-even.",

        "current_narrative": "Hi Lorna,  Thanks for sending this over.  There isn?t quite enough detail to completely benchmark this pricing, but I have sent it over to NPI?s OutSystems SME to see if they can help decipher it.    This appears to be for professional services and they have outlined some of the hours that they expect for each role, but there is a 4-month window that just says ?weekly support? for a Customer Service Engineer and an Engagement Manager.  Using the time estimates they HAVE provided, I am able to account for about ~$115K: ? 144 hours ? Engagement Mangaer ? Estimating $250/hr = $36K ? 200 hours ? Technical Lead ? Estimating $220/hr = $44K ? 160 hours ? Developer ? Estimating $180/hr = $28800 ? 32 hours ? Customer Service Engineer ? Estimating $200/hr = $6,400  So it will depend on how many hours are expected in ?Weekly Support? from the EM and CSE as to whether that will make up the additional $25K.  NPI recommends that Stericycle ask for a bit more detail behind these costs.  Since this is professional services, it is acceptable (and expected) that you should know the hourly rates and estimated # of hours for each role.  A common response to a request like this is that OutSystems will say, ?it could be 2 or it could be 5, we don?t know.?  Be assured that they have put together estimates on the level of effort in order to create this pricing.  Stericycle will want to know the estimated work effort  because that will determine if this pricing is fair or not.  If the EM and CSE will average 2-hours per week during that 4-month period, then the total cost comes to about $130K and Stericycle should seek a reduction.  If they will average 4+ hours per week, then this cost will be approximately break-even.",

Last year, the one-year term NPI reviewed had a blended 38.4% discount that rose to 43.4% in the final version.

        "current_narrative": "As always, thank you for reaching out to NPI concerning the migration from CloudHealth to YotaScale. Apologies for not getting back you yesterday. I hope this information is still useful and relevant.  Unfortunately, for as much information as NPI has about cloud services in general and AWS services and other iAAS providers, we simply don?t have that much data when it comes to YotaScale.  This should not come as a surprise, considering that they have only 24 employees listed on LinkedIn, several of which are board members and advisors, and they have only been in business since 2015. In fact, YotaScale is largely still living on funding, not revenue, and is still largely a fledgling company:   YotaScale, Inc. is a Silicon Valley startup that is defining infrastructure performance management for the cloud. It is funded by Pelion Venture Partners and Engineering Capital.  YotaScale rec?d $3.6M in funding just over one year ago. From a late 2017 Diginomica article, I gleaned the following excerpt:   As public cloud use proliferates and grows more comprehensive among large enterprises, the difficulty of tracking resource usage, spending and performance is an opportunity for software intelligence and automation. Vendors have cost management services like AWS Cost Explorer. However, these can flood users with data and don?t do a solid job of summarizing it by application, project or department, nor do they provide much help in identifying usage anomalies or their cause. These are just the sorts of insights software from YotaScale, a quasi-stealth startup, seeks to provide by applying machine learning to cloud workload and cost analysis as part of what co-founder and CEO Asim Razzaq calls ?AI-enhanced Infrastructure Performance Management.?  One thing that I can tell you is that the Waterfall pricing method that they are offering is likely receiving push back from clients other than Intuit. This idea that your initial investment continues to be penalized borders on the absurd. There is little incentive to grow your consumption (which Intuit certainly will) under this model. Intuit should push back and either invite YotaScale to lower the cost per EC2 instance to the $1/per offered in the 40K tier, or to change the terms such that when Intuit reaches the next volume tier all of the consumption is repriced to the next tier up.   Intuit does not often prepay for services, but in this particular case, given the commitment of less than $0.5M/year, and the ability to offset the cost of this service, if Intuit offered the cash hungry YotaScale a 3-year prepayment, you could likely push the offer from 15% to 20% and then gain an add?l 5-10% as a referenceable account.  Has Intuit conducted a POC with YotaScale, and if so, NPI assumes it was successful?  In closing, if Intuit is committed to the start-up tech that YotaScale offers, offering a 3-year deal at $1M may carry a lot of weight to company that is certainly hungry for a notable win.",

Attached is their current 3 yr proposal.   A little background: We currently have 82 licenses deployed and have been paying for 83 licenses the last few years. Note that this is the first time we have gotten this close to our previous years commitments of 83 servers. Our LOB has indicated that there is a potential for us to grow by 25 ? 35 licenses over the next 3 years.  Our contract has a server license price of $4,250 per server for 83+ servers and $5,395 for less than 83 servers. Production & DR servers are counted, non-production servers are not and the server metric is at 512GB. These server license prices are locked and ineligible for increase until 01/31/2019. Then it can be increased by 2% or CPI whichever is less annually thereafter.  We have requested that the date of 01/31/2019 be extended for 5 years and MongoDB has refused. They have not even countered with a revised expiration date as of yet. In addition, we have other TCs that we have sent to them to amend our contract with as well. i.e. True Up (annual reporting and true up of any licenses exceeding our entitlements, etc.).  Let me know if you have any questions and we look forward to your feedback.",

Since this was a smaller deal and you were out of the office, it got moved a little lower on the priority list.  Typically Oracle renewals are not very exciting.  Often, the best case scenario for a standard Oracle renewal is to have pricing remain flat from the previous year, which is what Oracle is offering in the 18-month proposal.  So NPI considers the 18-month renewal cost to be Fair Market Value (FMV).  In the 24-month and 36-month renewals, Oracle is offering additional discounting on the Multi-tenant service, but the Java CS is maintained at a 30% discount.  NPI sees no reason that the Java service should not also see moderate reductions (or increased discounting) if CNL is going to make a longer-term commitment.  NPI recommends targeting 35% discounting on the Java CS service for the 24-month renewal ? a reduction of ~$2K.  And we recommend targeting 40% discounting on the Java CS service for the 36-month renewal ? a reduction of ~$5K.  The messaging to Oracle is fairly simple, if CNL is going to make a longer-term commitment, it will need to be worth-your-while.  If there is no reduction in the largest cost of this renewal when we make a longer-term commitment, then we may as well just renew for 1-year and see if we will still need these services each year.   UPDATE: Closing as CNL no longer a client.",

Without both of those factors, it is difficult but still feasible to achieve savings targets. If Kofax already knows they?re the preferred vendor and/or no credible threat exists, NPI recommends manifesting uncertainty around this decision point.  Ideally, BNYM should float a high-level net target to the reseller and follow this with a short break in communication to make the vendors nervous about this forecasted deal.",

        "current_narrative": "Here are some thoughts on the SAS renewal:  NPI has observed that SAS is a vendor who likes to keep customers in the dark about their pricing.  They have different list pricing depending on the volume of spend and they are very inconsistent in the pricing they will agree to.  What this does tell us is that SAS pricing is highly negotiable.  We know that test environments are typically 25% of the production costs and list prices for Dev and Test are based on a percentage of the list price for the production environment.  There doesn?t seem to be quite enough information in this proposal (email) for NPI to provide a detailed benchmark.  Below are some thoughts and recommendations that VSP will want to consider.  ?\tAt first blush, the descriptions in the email you attached aren?t detailed enough for us to be able to calculate list price.  Additionally, there are no productions fees in the email description, so we are not able to determine list price and discount percentages for the Dev and Test environments.  If we have better descriptions of the licenses or - better still - if we have SKUs we can usually figure out list price and discount percentages for FYFs.  Having said that, Dev and Test environments list pricing tends to be a percentage of the production costs.  NOTE: NPI strongly recommends that you ask for list price on the FYFs so we can be sure we have the correct discount percentage.  SAS will share list price if pushed. ?\tWe like to see the first-RYF to be between 27-35% of the FYF.  VSP is at 28% for both the Dev and Test licenses, so that is good, however:   o\tWe still want to gauge the discount of the FYF fees even though we like 28% for the RYF. Often we see that a good RYF percentage is due to the first year fee is not well discounted. ?\tWe also like to see the third year fee to be 3% over the second year fee.  SAS has offered 5%.  That?s a standard starting offer.  Target 3%. ?\tHow big is VSPs overall footprint with SAS?  Can you provide financial details around your production environment?  That helps us adjust our targeted discount for this particular transaction.  It is largely handled standalone by SAS but the big picture should be considered especially if it benefits VSPs. ?\tThe professional services rates are actually very good in the SOW.  We usually don?t see large market variances in SAS professional services rates. o\tThe technical consultant is billed at $195. We see market rates between $195 - $200 per hour. o\tTechnical architects typically bill at $225 per hour. o\tThe Project Manager is billed at $180. We typically see this at $200 per hour.  If you can provide a bit more detail, I am confident that we can offer more detailed analysis of your SAS pricing.",

        "current_narrative": "NPI reviewed the rates from Accenture and found the overall blended rate of $159.65 to be in the range of FMV with room for improvement. While some of the individual rates are within FMV, other are at the high end of the range with room for improvement. In summary, NPI believes that there is potential for savings of about 5% of the total proposed cost of the project.  Pricing Analysis  ?\tTypical blended rates for the SFDC implementation (including offshore and onsite roles) vary between $150 per hour and $250 per hour based on the vendor and resource mix. Accenture?s blended rate is $159 per hour. ?\tSFDC?s stance in general is not to do implementations unless they have to.  They prefer to leave it to their partners.   o\tSFDC?s rates are typically in the $225-$250/hr range, so customers generally save money using service partners.   ?\tAdding to the conversation is the presence of India-based consultancies who often provide staff augmentation for some of the roles and leverage offshore resources.  NPI typically sees architect-level SFDC resources at rates around $120 - $150/hr from vendors like HCL, Infosys, and Cognizant. ?\tTypically, we see a phased approach where the Big 4/Accenture are involved in the initial assessment, strategy, change management, etc., and the ensuing implementation phases are bid out separately to other vendors, including mid-tier consulting firms and India-based consulting firms (who sometimes work in conjunction with the Big 4 on the implementation phases). ?\tNPI observed that 54% of the effort is offshore (in terms of the number of hours) and 46% is onsite. This is slightly higher than the typical range that NPI observes on SFDC implementation projects where 25% - 45% of the effort is offshore. This contributes to a lower blended rate. The high offshore utilization may be due to a larger offshore COE (Center of Excellence) for the SFDC practice. ?\tWhile the offshore rates seem extremely high (ranging between $35 and $105), NPI has observed that SFDC resource rates are much higher than the typical offshore rates that we see for other implementation and development projects (between $21 and $55). The same is true for onshore rates as well. ?\tNPI noted that there is a large difference between the hourly rates for the two change management content developer line items. Assuming one developer to be more senior, NPI has recommended a rate of $225 vs. $300 for the senior resource. At $185, the junior resource rate is FMV.\t ?\tThe tables below depict Accenture?s rates, NPI?s target rates and potential savings.",
        "customer_comments": "Pressed Rob but he held fast. Correct, the hourly figures did not change. Given that it was T&M and we needed to start quickly since we purchased software sooner than we thought, we just decided not to pursue.  It's possible that I may have to extend SOWs, so at that point I may reach out to you well in advance and push much harder related to the implementation resource cost.",

        "current_narrative": "Although the initial discounts offered by Dell EMC are respectable, NPI considers other external factors when classifying pricing and those areas should be considered in this negotiation.  NPI would typically expect to see both Hardware and Software discounted at 70% - 72% for deal of this size. Discounting at 69.5% places this pricing in the high range (and almost above FMV). ? Due to the timing of this fiscal year-end opportunity, NPI has increased the FMV target discount an additional percentage point, up to 73%. Achieving this target will result in approximately $51K in savings. ? Support is typically 20% of net HW/SW pricing for THREE years. In this offer, NPI finds that the support pricing is at 21% of HW/SW pricing, but only covers TWO years. \u00a92017 NPI, LLC. All Rights Reserved. NPI Confidential Information. May Not Be Disclosed to 3rd Parties. Page 3 ? NPI adjusted for this anomaly and increases the target discount to 82% of list for support. This discount results in a number that extrapolates out to 21% for the typical three-year term. Successfully negotiating this topic will result in approximately $39K in savings. ? Professional services is a rarely discounted line item and NPI finds that the small discounts that are seen are typically found in large deployments with large amounts of professional services. o NPI believes that these funds ARE somewhat flexible and because of the small dollar amount, NPI is applying the 23% discount that we periodically find in larger deployments to this proposal. Although this equates to a small $2K in savings, NPI mentions it as another negotiation point for Michael Kors.",

        "current_narrative": "Thanks for sending this over for NPI to review.  As I mentioned, NPI has good amount of data on Coupa, as well as a SME in our Advisor Network who also helps with reviews.  In the interest of a quick turnaround, please see notes below in lieu of a more formal document.    It appears that the document you sent over is a 2-year agreement that you signed last year.  It is not unusual that you are looking to discuss the subscription fees mid-contract because NPI has seen that many SaaS vendors are willing to discuss subscription costs off-cycle.  Sometimes, they will require an extension to the term of the contract, but they will typically agree to discuss the subscription rates.  Price Analysis and Negotiation Strategy First, a bit of history that NPI has seen with Coupa.  Prior to their IPO in October 2016, Coupa?s pricing was truly the wild-wild-west.  It was not uncommon that they would manipulate list pricing to show whatever discount percentage they wanted.  Since the IPO, as a public company with more scrutiny, they have tamed their pricing practices a bit, but NPI would not call it ?stable? pricing.  In September of 2016, Coupa hired Steve Winter, former SAP executive, as their CRO.  Steve has brought SAP?s ?keep?em guessing? pricing methodologies to Coupa.  That is, Coupa will change their pricing roughly every 90-days? maybe not wholesale changes, but name changes and moving ?bundles? around so it is difficult for the market to get a bead on their pricing.  In looking at Chico?s pricing in this 2-year agreement, using list prices that we have seen in other Coupa proposals for the 4 included applications, we believe this proposal is discounted between 35% - 50%.  NPI considers this level of discounting to be in the range of Fair Market Value (FMV).  Chico?s may want to ask Coupa for list pricing for this proposal to see what they are claiming is the discount percentage.  Coupa will often push back on providing list price and if they provide it, it will need to be taken with a grain of salt ? see notes above about constant changes in pricing.  Having said the above we would also add that, based on the competitive landscape of the market, NPI believes there may be at least some small savings on this contract.  There are literally hundreds of  vendors that will do ?3-bids and a buy? functionality that Coupa sees as competitors to their S2P environment.  Even though many are not as robust as Coupa, they are credible enough to be a threat.  A message along the lines of, ?Verian (now part of Basware) has been courting us and as we?ve been evaluating their product, it appears it will satisfy most of our requirements at nearly half the cost.?, will get Coupa?s attention.  Other competitors worth mentioning: Jagger (formerly Sciquest), Zycus, Determine, GEP.  If Coupa asks for a target reduction, NPI recommends setting a target of a 20% reduction, but any improvement at all on this pricing is really icing on the cake.  Closing as FMV ... significant scope change - cut user count in half and paying more than initial quote.  Coupa recently (May 2017) acquired a company called Trade Extensions.  Trade Extensions is a top-of-the-line trading platform and significantly improves on the ?3-bids and a buy? functionality.  If Coupa offers to throw Trade Extensions in, NPI considers that a big concession.",

        "current_narrative": "Robert, Hey there.  Must be something about this space and how their vendors conceal their list prices.  I guess as security companies they are practicing what they preach ?.  While we?ve seen several Vormetric deals the SKUs often vary across our reviews and they don?t always show list pricing.  However, they do at times so we know they will provide it if asked.  Again, we got resourceful and tried to work through this and also leverage some public data.  I just got to a point where I think we are better off asking Trace3 to show add more transparency in their quote.  I think the SKUs are correct so that?s some good news.  The attached Excel file shows the work in progress.  I haven?t suggested targets yet since there?s too many open items.  Of note:  ?\tVOR-TE ? listed for $6K about 12 months ago.  Let?s confirm this.  You may also want to take this time and ask about the bundled list price (and even net) that includes the Transparent Encryption Agent, Application Encryption and Tokenization. Another client bought the bundle (at MUCH bigger volumes ? 1,500) but paid $1K for each bundle. Webster is at $3,150 for just TE. You?re at less than 2% of their volume but I?m curious what they?d offer and it may be good to know if that?s on your roadmap.  If only two of these are of interest I don?t think they have a bundle for that but you could ask.  This other client didn?t have the Tokenization Client license so perhaps they?re configuring their solution differently than Webster. o\tThe quantity of 25 for VOR-TE and VOR-VTE-LTD brings up another topic to push for clarity on. From the limited pricing I?ve seen there?s a clear example on their Data Encryption Agent license where the first one is $6K, ten cost $45K (or $4500 each) and 25 cost $100K or $4K each).  I think now is the time to make sure they show you what all these tiers look like to ensure you?re getting both the programmatic volume discount and the additional discount you?d get on a first-time competitive buy. ?\tVOR-VTE-LTD ? the one item I had no traction finding list pricing for ?\tVOR-TOKEN ? educated guess is this is also at $6K list ?\tThe DSM Enterprise Parts I believe have the same list and they just discount non-prod more than prod.  The list could be $30K or something north of $40K.  That reflects quite a swing in discounting so it is a key item to validate.  I?d be appreciative if you could also ask them for the list price of the physical DSM Enterprise equivalent. Perhaps you could say someone asked about that option and you wanted to understand it more.  I think it lists for at least $5K more. ?\tOn the Support side, Standard is always 18% of net and Premium is 22%.  We?ve never seen Premium+ which is what?s reflected on your quote.  Below is a picture of the comparison of these two in their SW Lic Agreement.  They?re offering the + at 23% of the total hardware and software net.  Doesn?t sound like a bad uplift over Premium assuming you?re getting something more.  Consider your options there.  ?\tSome services details are shown. o\tVormetric?s rack rate is $2,500/day. VOR-PRO-SERV is the SKU.  We?ve seen it not discounted typically.   o\tProgram Review and Roadmap Dev seems like it?ll be work done by Trace3 for a fixed fee of $51,800. They mention a Security Architect and PM. No hours are mentioned.   We?d expect this to reflect some hourly estimate applied against the rates and then a 10-20% uplift for the risk involved with a fixed fee engagement.  Maybe ask about a T&M to get exposure to the rates and effort. o\tProduct Install appears to be Vormetric people.  Offered at $12,500 that?s 5 days at their $2,500 rack rate.  That number of days doesn?t seem bloated.  In a competitive environment feels like that could be something to push for free. o\tTech Design and Impl - $67,500 for 6 weeks. That?s $11,250 a week or $2,250 a day if one resource which is exactly 10% off the Vormetric daily rack rate of $2500. It includes an Architect, Engineer and PM but again is offered at a fixed amount so no effort/hours noted.  Push for some clarity around this.  Is this Trace3 or Vormetric. On the one hand you?d expect a lower rate with Trace3 but oftentimes partners bring more senior resources to bear than the OEM/Publisher. o\tRoadmap and Mentoring is offered at $51,800 and is T&M. It is largely an architect at $300.  We can benchmark this.  Is this Trace3 or Vormetric.  We?ll work on what we can but let me know if you expect to reach out to Trace3 for this additional detail.  Now is the time and no reason to spend this money if there?s any questions about the transparency of the offer.  Also, do you expect future growth.  Getting transparency now sets you up for that.",
        "customer_comments": "Went with Vormetric.  Final quote increased in size largely due to Token Server Client item growing from 1 to 18.  The only reductions appear to be on the DSM units as both the Prod and non prod had reductions.  Maintenance also dropped from 23% to 20%.   The initial quotes didn't clear show all the non prod info that was shown in the final.  Estimating savings and new baseline but not overthinking it.  Future folks should use the final docs (also some list pricing in XLS) and new SME.",

Currently key management at Webster Bank is not a cohesive process but maintained by the individual systems that use keys.  Reply to first offer: We?ll take a look.  From my first pass I can tell you the Trace3 (Vormetric) SOW is too light on details.  There?s a lot ($530K+) of services with no resources, rates and hours so it can?t be benchmarked.  There?s also a sizable placeholder for hardware, licenses and support for $501K with no detail.

Without both of those factors, it is difficult but still feasible to achieve savings targets. If Kofax already knows they?re the preferred vendor and/or no credible threat exists, NPI recommends manifesting uncertainty around this decision point.  Ideally, BNYM should float a high-level net target to the reseller and follow this with a short break in communication to make the vendors nervous about this forecasted deal.",
        "customer_comments": "?\tNPI suggests using a rounded net amount of $800k as a talking point with the reseller and vendor, and to avoid mentioning any specific discounting. Say that this is the target needed to keep this within the March timeframe. o\tMessaging can focus on attaining a slight relief on capital costs, but also emphasize that high relative operational expenses are the main factor causing BNYM to pause before proceeding with this purchase.",

We indicated this was mostly FMV with opportunity, but client is trying not to count this as a report   BNYM is reviewing a proposal from reseller Document Imaging Group for Kofax?s TotalAgility platform.",
