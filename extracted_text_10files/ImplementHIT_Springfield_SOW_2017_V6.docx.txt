EXHIBIT B - SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT During the Term of the ImplementHIT License Agreement, (as applicable, the "Agreement"), the Covered Service will provide a Monthly Uptime Percentage to Customer of at least 99% (the "SLA"). If ImplementHIT does not meet the SLA, and if Customer meets its obligations under this SLA, Customer will be eligible to receive the Financial Credits described below.

The following definitions apply to the ImplementHIT SLA: "Downtime Period" means, for the platform, a period of five consecutive minutes of Downtime. Intermittent Downtime for a period of less than five minutes will not be counted towards any Downtime Periods.

--- Chunk 10 ---
"Financial Credit" means the following: "Monthly Uptime Percentage" means total number of minutes in a month, minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered from all Downtime Periods in a month, divided by the total number of minutes in a month. Customer Must Request Financial Credit In order to receive any of the Financial Credits described above, Customer must notify ImplementHIT within thirty days from the time Customer becomes eligible to receive a Financial Credit.

--- Chunk 11 ---
Failure to comply with this requirement will forfeit Customer's right to receive a Financial Credit.
