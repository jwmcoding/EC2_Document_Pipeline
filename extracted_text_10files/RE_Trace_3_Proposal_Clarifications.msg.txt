As promised, attached is the Product Quote along with the breakdown of services.

We would like to contract for the majority of the work as Fixed Bid (much like the AppD deployment)  including: * Program Review and Roadmap Development - $51,800 * Includes Security Architect * PM * Product Install - $12,500 * Leveraging Vendor Provided SMEs * Technology Design & Implementation - $67,500 * Includes Principal Security Architect * Security Engineer * PM Roadmap Mentoring Support  we believe this should be T&M so that you only pay for what you use.

--- Chunk 5 ---
Estimated need: $51,800 * Principal Security Architect 160 hrs x $300/hr = $48,000 * PM 19 hrs x $200 = $3,800 Please let me know if you need any additional detail.
