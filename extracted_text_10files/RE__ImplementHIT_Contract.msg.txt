NPI reviewed the SOW from ImplementHIT and found the pricing to be well within Fair Market Value. A Jimenez MD MSED is the CEO of ImplementHIT and a $250 per hour rate for a senior consulting role is well within FMV. Market range is between $200/hour and $315/per hour. The other resources are priced at $140 per hour which is also at Fair Market Value. Typical market range is $125 - $150 per hour.

--- Chunk 3 ---
Typical market range is $125 - $150 per hour. Furthermore, ImplementHIT has provided a discount of 20% on the consulting fees which makes the cost very competitive. Overall, based on comparisons to market rates, Springfield Clinic is good to go with this purchase.
